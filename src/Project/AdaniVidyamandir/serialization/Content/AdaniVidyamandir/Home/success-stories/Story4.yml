        Mandeepsinh Kunwarsinh Gohil is the son of a farmer who hails from Botad (Gujarat). His family of 5 – including parents and siblings – toils endlessly to make ends meet. Mandeepsinh’s childhood was spent working in the farm or doing menial labour jobs, while sporadically attending a small school in Gadhada, Botad. Things changed when Mandeepsinh’ uncle intervened and encouraged him to apply for admission at AVMB in class 7. He could now devote all his time to being student and do the things that children of his age do. His intelligence, hard work, sincerity and teachers’ support led him to excel in academics. He was able to pass class 10 exams with flying colours. 
        The staff at AVMB and Adani Foundation supported him with career guidance, aptitude assessment and financial means for further studies – he finally pursued mechanical engineering at HJD Institute of Engineering, Kera (Kutch). Today, Mandeepsinh is an engineer, standing on his own two feet and providing better living conditions to his family.
