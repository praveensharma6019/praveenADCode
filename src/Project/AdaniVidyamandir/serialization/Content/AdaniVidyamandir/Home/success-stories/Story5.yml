        The academic year 2020-21 was challenging in an unprecedented manner for all the stakeholders of AVMS. During the pandemic, AVMS made the best use of technology. Online Classes were conducted via <strong>Google Classroom</strong> and <strong>WhatsApp</strong>. The dormant, but indomitable spirit of young learners of AVMS was rekindled by the introduction of online classes, making them familiar with digital tools and even exciting them at the myriad possibilities. Where the online classes could not bridge the gap wholly, the faculty of AVMS went door to door, fulfilling the learning requirements of each child. The <strong>terminal examination</strong> was also held online, and evaluation was conducted digitally. This was a novel experience for both students and teachers. 
        The <strong>AVMS Faculty</strong> empowered themselves with the help of workshops to cope with the prevailing digital requirements of students in academics. 
        The annual examination was conducted offline, mobilizing the support of parents in the respective locality of the students. Further, AVMS initiated <strong>mohalla classes</strong> to facilitate the Class X students in their preparation for <strong>CBSE Board Examination</strong>. The Class X students were divided into three batches to ensure the social distancing as per the <strong>Covid-19</strong> guidelines and classes for the three different batches were simultaneously conducted in the school vicinity. The first batch of AVMS appeared for the Board Examination in May, 2021.
