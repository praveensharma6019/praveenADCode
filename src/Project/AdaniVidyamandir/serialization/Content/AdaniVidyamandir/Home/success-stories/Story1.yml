      Value: "Dr. Harshil Modi is an AVMA alumnus from the batch of 2016. He has completed 4.5 years of MBBS and was undergoing internship at Baroda Medical College, M.S. University. His small, middle-class family includes his mother and brother – the siblings were raised single-handedly by the mother amidst many difficulties. It is from her that Harsh has learnt to face hardships with great fortitude. In a similar manner, he is grateful to Adani Vidya Mandir, Ahmedabad and credits his teachers for channelizing his energy in the right direction. The clarity of thought he developed at school and the moral values which were stressed upon in school, made him a compassionate person and this very quality is making him excel in the medical field. He considers AVMA as a boon for providing him the right platform to fulfil his dream of becoming a doctor. During coronavirus crisis, he did his duty at the frontline fearlessly, helping and curing patients untiringly."
