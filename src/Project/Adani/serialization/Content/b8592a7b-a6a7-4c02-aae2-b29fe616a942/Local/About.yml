        <br /><p dir="ltr">

Average Plant Load Factor (PLF) achieved during the third quarter of FY18 was 58%, lower as compared to 69% achieved in Q3 FY17. Lower PLF during Q3 FY18 was as a result of lower domestic coal availability at Tiroda and Kawai and forced outage at Udupi, as well as scheduled maintenance.</p>

        EBIDTA during Q3 FY18 was Rs. 800 crore, as compared to Rs. 1,364 crore in Q3FY17. EBITDA during the quarter was lower due to arrears of transmission charges of Rs. 287 crores not pertaining to the quarter, and lower fixed capacity charge revenue due to lower billed availability.</p>
        <br /><p dir="ltr">
        Net loss for 9M FY18 was Rs. 1,450 crore, as compared to Net loss of Rs. 1,219 crore for 9M FY17. Net Loss for Q3 FY18 stood at Rs. 1,288 crore as compared to Net Loss of Rs. 670 crore in Q3FY17.</p>

        <br /><p dir="ltr">
        <strong>Commenting on the quarterly results of the Company, Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Power said,</strong> &ldquo;We expect to receive coal linkages under the SHAKTI scheme for the Tiroda and Kawai plants in the near future, which will help reduce fuel costs and improve profitability of these projects. Under-recovery of fuel costs for Mundra project have been impacted its financial viability, and we are in dialogue with key stakeholders for an early solution.</p>
        <br /><p dir="ltr">
