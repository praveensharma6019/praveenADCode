        				<p class="mb-3">When I was recruited in 2008 as a Graduate Engineer Trainee by Adani from my Nagpur University campus, I knew was on the right path. After 5 months of training and exposure, I realized that I was working with an organization that valued transparency, freedom and trust. Today, upon these very ideals, the Adani Group stands as a storied nation-builder, and it feels amazing to have been a part of their journey.</p>
        				<p class="mb-3">At Adani, I chose to be an engineer in the Marine department. This is where my love affair with the Mundra port began. Today, I lead a team of 35 amazing people as a Container Terminal Engineering manager looking after the CT2 mechanical section. And I could not be more proud of the work we are doing here to transform India’s maritime economy through the development of Mundra.</p>

        				<p class="mb-3">I respect the fact that safety is emphasized a lot at Mundra and in the Adani culture. This is why we start the day with the Safety Walk the Talk – an initiative where we reinforce our safety training. Thereafter, we review the pending tasks as well as the tasks of the day, before reviewing all the breakdowns of the previous day in a meeting. Next comes the time to conduct rounds where we meet those breakdown engineers – our true heroes who are there, who actually work on ground, who ensure that the reliability of the equipment are kept at the highest possible level. Overall, we not only focus on the productivity and the business but also on individual learning and development of the team as well.</p>

        				<p class="mb-3">For 7 years, I cherished working in the Marine department where I got incredible opportunities to spread my wings and soar high.</p>
        				<p class="mb-3">I would like to talk about the how I tried and tested the new tugboat ship Adani had procured during my time in the Marine department. In 2011, I, along with my colleagues, went to Tokyo where we visited the Oath factory of Niagara Power – a manufacturer of tugboat engines and transmission. For a guy like me with only 5 years of experience to be asked by my boss to handle the tugboat trials and take his place and visit Japan to learn and come back with expertise was incredible! It goes on to show the courage and the faith displayed by the company and its veterans in young employees – something that truly made me and my colleagues feel empowered.</p>
        				</div>
        		</div>
        		<p class="mb-3">From there on, it’s been a transition which is only possible in a company like Adani, wherein you are given the opportunities to actually demonstrate the capabilities you have and lay foundations of success for the company and the country. A similar opportunity was presented to me in 2010 when I was asked to lead the Adani’s first ever dredger shifting assignment from Mundra to Dahej. Such opportunities are what make it all worthwhile. </p>
        				<h3 class="txt-md mb-3 border-l">Putting the best foot forward for India</h3>
        				<p class="mb-3">My team and I have seen the Mundra port grow into India’s biggest gateway of trade and prosperity. And behind this growth story, I am so proud and honoured to have played a small part. The way I see it, the Mundra port is much more than just a hub of economic progress. </p>
        				<p class="mb-3">Every day, so many ships and tankers from abroad land ashore at Mundra, conduct business with us, and take back an impression about our country. This is what makes our role here so challenging. After all, the way we facilitate them at the port with the help of machinery, or the way we handle our communication with them leaves an indelible mark upon their minds about Indian people and Indian culture. Thus, every day, we try to represent the country in our work. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have an opportunity to do so.</p>
