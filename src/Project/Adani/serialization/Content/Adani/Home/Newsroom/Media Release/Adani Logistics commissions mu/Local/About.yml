In comparison, during Q3 FY 2018-19, APL and its subsidiaries achieved an average PLF of 73% and sales volume of 15.8 BU. This lower PLF during Q3 FY2019-20 was primarily a result of lower grid demand and higher renewable energy generation, while the inclusion of REL helped improve sales volumes. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Consolidated Total Income for Q3 FY 2019-20 stood at Rs. 6,685 Crore, as compared to Rs. 6,667 Crore in Q3 FY 2018-19.
