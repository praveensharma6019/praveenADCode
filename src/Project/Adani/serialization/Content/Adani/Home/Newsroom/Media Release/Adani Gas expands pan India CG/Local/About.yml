        <p><strong>New Delhi, November 21, 2018:</strong> Adani Gas Ltd. (AGL), the city gas distribution arm of the Adani Group, has bagged authorization from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, Government of India to expand its city gas footprint in 13 new Geographical Areas (GAs) in the recently concluded 9th round of CGD bidding. In addition, the company has also won 9 GAs in its joint venture company with Indian Oil Corporation, i.e. Indian Oil - Adani Gas Ltd. (IOAGPL).</p>
        <br /><p>In a national event being held in the capital on 22nd November, the Hon&rsquo;ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stones of City Gas Distribution (CGD) projects in 65 GAs covering 129 districts recently allocated in the 9th CGD bidding. The ceremony will be broadcasted LIVE from all locations where dignitaries from the respective State Governments and PNGRB will grace the landmark event.</p>
        <br /><p><strong>Pranav Adani, Managing Director, Agro, Oil and Gas, Adani Group </strong>stated, &ldquo;Government of India has set itself a target to increase the share of natural gas in India&rsquo;s primary energy mix to 15% till 2022 from the 6.5% in 2015. Given the pressing need for energy security in the country, natural gas is set to play a critical role in India&rsquo;s energy strategy. With authorization to develop gas infrastructure and distribute natural gas in 13 new geographic areas in AGL and 9 GAs in IOAGPL, we continue to be at the forefront of the Indian natural gas story. We endeavor to utilize our decade-long experience and CGD expertise to expeditiously develop these new geographical areas to provide gas to consumers in an economic, reliable and safe manner using the state-of-the-art technology and automation tools.&rdquo;</p>
        <br /><p>This will mark as another major achievement by the Hon&rsquo;ble Prime Minister, who is committed to the reduction of India&rsquo;s carbon footprint achievable through timely adoption of natural gas. In his speech in Urja Sangam 2015 in New Delhi, he stated that &ldquo;in the next four years, piped gas connections will increase from 28 lakh to 1 crore to reduce pollution in the cities.&rdquo; The development of CGD network in 65 Geographical Areas is also expected to generate significant employment opportunities.</p>
