      Hint: Description
      Value: |
        <p class="d-block">Gautam Adani is the founder and Chairman of the Adani Group. Established in 1988 as a trading Company, the Adani Group&rsquo;s foray into infrastructure building began in 1998. In the span of two decades, the Group has emerged as India&rsquo;s largest ports and logistics business, largest private power and transmission player, largest solar power generation and manufacturing company, largest integrated coal management company, and largest agriculture business. The Group is comprised of 4 publicly traded companies with combined revenues of $11 billion and a CAGR of 25% over the past 5 years.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="d-block">Mr. Adani is increasingly driven by one core philosophy &ndash; Nation Building. Each of the Group&rsquo;s core businesses are focused on helping build world class integrated infrastructure capabilities that India needs to accelerate its growth. Nation building, for Mr. Adani, means transforming the coastline of India by building a series of ports and related logistic hubs and in the process generate several tens of thousands of jobs. It means transforming the power scenario in India and getting electricity to the several hundreds of millions who need electricity. It means enabling the food security by building a modern agriculture supply chain that empowers the farmers of our country. It means to fulfill India&rsquo;s objective and become one of the largest global players in sustainable energy by making the largest national commitment to the solar ecosystem and building an integrated manufacturing, generation, and solar park business.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="d-none">Adani Agri Logistics is a pioneer in bulk handling, storage and transportation (distribution) of food grains, and in providing an end-to-end bulk supply chain solution to Food Corporation of India and various state governments. The company commissioned India&rsquo;s first modern grain storage infrastructure for Food Corporation of India in 2007. It commissioned grain silos in Moga (Punjab) and Kaithal (Haryana) to store grains, and established receiving silos in Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Coimbatore, cities connected through Adani&rsquo;s dedicated railway rakes.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="d-none">A key principle that drives Mr. Adani&rsquo;s thinking is that, if anything is worth doing, then it should be done on a global scale and given India&rsquo;s rapid growth, the way to build global scale is to use India as the launching pad. First, the organization gets a set goal &ndash; to aim to be number one - and that by itself is motivating for the team to rally round a precise objective. Second, the scale that emerges by thinking big drives solutions that otherwise may have seemed infeasible or uneconomical. And third and most importantly, such vision helps attract the type of people that get excited by the massive challenges that many businesses would not even consider. Over the years this has become the core mantra of success for the leadership philosophy Mr. Adani has espoused and the Group&rsquo;s growth is a manifestation of the Company&rsquo;s empowered leaders delivering extraordinary results.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="d-none">Adani Foundation is the Group&rsquo;s Corporate Social Responsibility arm and has increasingly become a key area of focus for Mr. Adani. The Adani Foundation&rsquo;s healthcare programs touch the lives of over 200,000 people every year. The sustainable livelihood programs have made over 35,000 people and their families self-reliant and the Foundation has improved the lives of over 500,000 people across 177 villages by helping provide better roads, drinking water, and other basic facilities. Ms. Priti Adani, the wife of Mr. Adani is the Chair Person of the Adani Foundation.</p>
