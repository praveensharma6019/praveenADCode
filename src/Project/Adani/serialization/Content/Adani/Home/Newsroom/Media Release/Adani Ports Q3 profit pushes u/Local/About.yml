        </ul>
        
        <p dir="ltr">The Profit after Tax would have been higher but for higher tax incidence to Rs. 1148 crs in 9M FY18 from Rs.275 crs in 9M FY17. This is because Mundra port has come out of tax holiday period. However, from cash flow angle there is no incremental impact as company has MAT credit entitlement of Rs.2700 crs.</p>

        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Mr. Karan Adani, Chief Executive Officer and Whole Time Director of APSEZ said,</strong> “Cargo Volumes growth in Q3FY18 rebounded after a tepid Q2FY18. This growth was led by all round double digit growth in all major cargo that we handle. We foresee continued uptick in cargo volumes in India. While western ports in India will continue to grow we are confident of exponential cargo volume growth in Eastern and Southern coasts of India. We would continue to increase our footprints in the Logistics space. This will further improve our port to hinterland connectivity. We would thus aim to become a truly fully integrated player providing end to end service to our customers. We are progressing towards achieving an operating income of Rs. 10,000 crs in FY18 which will be another milestone in the history of APSEZ ltd.,</p>
