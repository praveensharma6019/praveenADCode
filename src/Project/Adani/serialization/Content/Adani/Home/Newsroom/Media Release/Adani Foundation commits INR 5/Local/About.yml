        </p><p><strong>Ahmedabad, August 23 2018;</strong> Adani Foundation the CSR, sustainability and community outreach arm of the Adani Group, has committed INR 50 crore to the Kerala Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund, to support the people affected by the recent spate of devastating floods. The financial assistance will be dispatched in phases to aid the state in its herculean task of reconstruction and rehabilitation. In showing a concerted commitment, the Group’s employees have pledged a day’s salary to express solidarity with the state’s distressed people.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
        The Foundation, whose core ethos is nation-building and the empowerment of citizens, has also started massive rehabilitation work in collaboration with Adani Vizhinjam Port Pvt. Ltd. The on-ground team has been working relentlessly, participating in flood relief activities in the worst affected areas. The team consisting of staff and volunteers, have travelled through nights to remote villages reaching out to the tribal population, distributing thousands of kits including rations, clothes and other necessary supplies to people in relief camps. The relief team reached out to people in Kokkathode, Mundanplavu, Nellikkampara and Kottampara Kurisadi Junction in Aruvapulam Panchayath; Thekkemala, Vanchipramala, Catholic church and St.George Orhtodox church in Mallappuzhasseri Panchayath, Mangaram and Maroor villages in Konni.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Each relief kit contains rice, rice flakes, biscuits, bath soap, wash soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, candles, matchbox, lungi, nightclothes and cloth bags.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
        The Foundation has also pressed into service its Mobile Healthcare Van. With flood waters starting to recede, there is a serious health concern developing in the region. To help prevent outbreak of epidemics, the Mobile Healthcare Van with a doctor, pharmacist and social worker will be stationed at relief camps in Kozhancherry and Pattanamthitta, catering to the needs of about 200 people every day. The Kerala government’s response mechanism to address the flood situation has been very fast – earlier the relief work was flagged off by the Hon'ble Port Minister Shri Kadannappalli Ramachandran in the presence of Trivandrum District Collector Dr.Vasuki IAS, on August 21, 2018. Adani Foundation will continue to work relentlessly and unabatedly in collaboration with the state agencies until the situation normalises.</p>
