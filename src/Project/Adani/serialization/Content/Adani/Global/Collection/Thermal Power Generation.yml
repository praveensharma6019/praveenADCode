        <p class="d-block mb-3">What more can power do than light up houses? It can brighten futures, not just of individuals but of communities at large thereby creating a growth story, ramifying throughout the country, one smile at a time. India&rsquo;s nationalised enterprises have struggled to meet the rising energy demands chocking dreams to darkness. Estimates suggest that by 2020, the private sector will account for 40% of the electricity generated and with Adani as the largest thermal private power player on a mission to help India become self-reliant in power generation, we are positive of seeing various possibilities and dreams come true.</p>
        <p class="d-none mb-3">Adani's thermal power portfolio comprises 10,440 MW across four plants at Mundra, Tiroda, Kawai and Udupi. This makes the company India&rsquo;s largest private sector power player. The power generated here is witnessing businesses grow, literacy rise and livelihood flourish.</p>
        <p class="d-none ">For the world&rsquo;s first company capable to set up a coal-based super critical thermal power project registered under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of Kyoto protocol, this is just the beginning in the continuing journey of goodness.</p>
