        <p class="d-block mb-3">Water remains an integral part of our sustainable development initiatives. With growing concerns about supply and availability of water resources, policy makers are focusing on infrastructure projects that aid its conservation. We propose to build new Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and rehabilitate existing STPs. Along with that, we also focus on opportunities in areas of Irrigation Infrastructure Development, Large Water Supply & Water Distribution Projects and Desalination Projects to produce potable water for general consumption or industrial use.
