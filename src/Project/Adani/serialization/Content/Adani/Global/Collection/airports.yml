        <p class="d-block mb-3">The Adani Group has forayed into the civil aviation sector by strategically acquiring Airport Development & Maintenance mandates throughout the country. This move is bolstered by the Group’s desire to upgrade the existing airport infrastructure in India to the best-in-class standards, thus offering passengers the most seamless and secure airport experience.</p>
        <p class="d-block mb-3">Having bid for six Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports, AEL has emerged as the highest bidder for all of these that had been put up for privatization:
        Ahmedabad | Trivandrum | Lucknow | Mangaluru | Guwahati | Jaipur
        </p>
