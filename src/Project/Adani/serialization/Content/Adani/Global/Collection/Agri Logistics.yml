        <p class="d-block mb-3">Those who feed us deserve their fair share. We, at Adani ensure that farmers get their due credit for every drop of sweat they&rsquo;ve shed in generating the best quality produce for the nation. We rely on our scale to bring about this goodness.</p>
        <p class="d-none mb-3">Adani Agri Logistics is a pioneer in bulk handling, storage and transportation (distribution) of food grains, and in providing an end-to-end bulk supply chain solution to Food Corporation of India and various state governments. The company commissioned India&rsquo;s first modern grain storage infrastructure for Food Corporation of India in 2007. It commissioned grain silos in Moga (Punjab) and Kaithal (Haryana) to store grains, and established receiving silos in Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Coimbatore, cities connected through Adani&rsquo;s dedicated railway rakes.</p>
