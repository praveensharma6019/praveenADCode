        <p>A transmission agreement has been signed between AREPRL and PGCIL for transmission of power from Fatehgarh Solar Power Park in Jaisalmer. The dedicated transmission system required for direct injection/withdrawl of power from the solar park has been finalized in accordance with the Provision of Electricity Act, 2003. The generation capacity of the park is 1,500 MW. Connectivity for 1,000 MW has been granted at a proposed 400kV pooling station (with a provision to upgrade to a 765kV station).</p>
