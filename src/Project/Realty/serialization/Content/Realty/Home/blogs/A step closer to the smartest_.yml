        Adani Realty, one of the leading developers in India will be participating in the Indian Property Show, Dubai. Over 150 developers will be taking part in the event which is expected attract over 15,000 visitors.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Adani Realty is the latest offspring of Adani Wilmar, one of India&rsquo;s leading conglomerates and a prominent global integrated infrastructure developer. With the promise of &lsquo;The Good Life&rsquo; and affordable homes to Indians, Adani Realty is set to change the country&rsquo;s skyline with its iconic residential, commercial and social developments. Since its inception in 2011, Adani Realty has developed almost 69 million sq. ft. and has many accolades under its wing. Its landmark developments are Shantigram, the largest integrated township in Ahmedabad, The Belvedere Golf and Country Club &ndash; the largest private social club in India and Inspire, an upcoming commercial office complex in Bandra Kurla Complex.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Relationships have always been at the heart of business at Adani Realty and the participation in the show will help fortify existing relationships and forge new ones. It&rsquo;s the 18th edition of Indian Property Show and this expo aims to help the potential buyers make the right investment choices, offering a broader view and better understanding of various existing and upcoming real estate developments, one-on-one interaction with various developers. The visitors will be able to compare prices of residential, commercial and mixed-use units and take a decision at the venue itself. Amazing deals, attractive prices, reputed developers and a wide range of affordable to uber-luxurious properties from across India will be the highlights of the event. Watch a handpicked line-up of industry experts address the latest trends in the market in various seminars organised at the expo. Investment gurus, property consultants, legal advisors and banking veterans will share their insights on various subjects. The event will be held at the World Trade Centre from 8th to 10th December 2016.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        This property expo couldn&rsquo;t have been timed better, considering the market has never been riper and the coming years would be a different story.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The Real Estate Regulation Act 2016 is perceived to be a wise move that tomorrow will reward by industry veterans. The Regulation Act will lead to more transparency and further institutionalise the market. Besides this, the emerging growth corridors such as the Smart Cities Mission and Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor has led to the creation of new employment opportunities which in turn has created a great demand for residential and commercial developments. The sluggish market and the dip in the prices have led many home buyers to believe that the prices would fall even further in the coming years. But this wait would be in vain as experts predict that the next year would witness a surge in the prices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        But that said, one should take into account factors such as the reputation of the builder, the appreciation value, the location among many while making an investment decision.&nbsp; Backed by the remarkable legacy of Adani Group, a prominent player in the infrastructure development of India with over 2 decades of experience, Adani Realty is built on trust and is known for projects set apart by meticulous planning, thoughtful design and speed of execution. Clearly, a visit to Adani Realty&rsquo;s stall at the Indian Show will leave one with the smartest investment choices in real estate.</p>
