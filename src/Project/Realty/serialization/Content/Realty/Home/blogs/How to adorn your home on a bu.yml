        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%.

        A greatly simple way to give your house a quick new look is to de-clutter and re-organize it. Do away with paintings, old pieces of art, broken artifacts that once graced your homes. Re-arrange the placement of your sofa or your dining table and you&rsquo;ll see how different your home looks. If you have a personal deck in your home, you could have a pair of coffee chairs on the balcony where you can sit and enjoy your evening tea or spend your evenings chatting up with your friends.</p>

        The right amount of light has a lot to do with one&rsquo;s mood. Lots of light during the day and soft and dim light during the night are just the perfect mood enhancers. Make sure to clean the windows at regular intervals, open the curtains and let sufficient light in. Good amount of sunlight is also said to attract positive energies if Vastu Shastra is to be believed. If your home is surrounded by greenery, overlooks a beautiful lake or is simply adorned by a scenic sight, you could consider having large windows to enjoy the view.</p>

        Instantly deck up your home with pot plants that not only glorify your home but also assure pure and cleaner air for you to breathe. You could choose colorful metal pots over the regular mundane mud ones. Colored pots will help add an extra dash of color to your room apart from giving it a lift. Moreover, who doesn&rsquo;t like being welcomed by the soothing fragrance and the mesmerizing sight of fresh flowers?</p>

        Think through an appealing theme for your home that will please your eye. If you are living in a lakeside apartment, you could give your walls a blue shade with similar shade furniture to match the placid lake that fences your apartment. Similarly, if you own a villa, which of course has ample space, you could choose antique pieces of art and sculptures to embellish your home. For homes that overlook huge sports fields or playgrounds, the kid's room could be festooned with a sports theme. The walls could be given a chalkboard finish to make it look like an ever-changing scoreboard. A small bedside lamp supported by a hockey stick would make for a lovely lampshade while a cricket themed rug would complete the look.</p>
