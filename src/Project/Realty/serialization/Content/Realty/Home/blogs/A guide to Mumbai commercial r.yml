        <span style="background: #ffffff;">Here are some guidelines to consider while investing in </span><span style="background: #ffffff;">commercial property in Mumbai-</span><span style="background: #ffffff;"> </span></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
            <span style="background: #ffffff;">Study the quality of the building, location, demand &amp; supply dynamics, and yield compression possibility.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
            <span style="background: #ffffff;">Ensure that the amenities in the project match your business needs.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
            <span style="background: #ffffff;">Check the developer&rsquo;s credentials, the potential for infrastructure development, access to public transport and quality of property management.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
            <span style="background: #ffffff;">Investors looking at income-producing office assets should look at the break-up of cash flows, the vacancy factor, expenses such as maintenance, property tax and building insurance, lease term, lock-in period and expiry dates,&nbsp;long-term capital appreciation potential and refurbishment, refinancing and re-positioning potential.</span></p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
            <span style="background: #ffffff;">For a commercial space leased or rented for retail or related services, visitor footfall is the biggest criterion. Ensure such property is located near popular hangouts such as cinema multiplexes, restaurants or commercial hubs.</span></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
