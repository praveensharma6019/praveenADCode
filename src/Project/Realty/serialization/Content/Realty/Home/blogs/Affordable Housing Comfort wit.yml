        Affordable housing</p>
        <p>
        With the increasing demand for space and the need to accommodate the increasing population, there is a huge demand and need for affordable housing. What exactly are affordable homes? Although the expression of affordable housing is quite generic and may have the different meaning for every individual, the underlying meaning more or less remains the same - that affordable apartments should address the housing needs of the lower or middle-income households. The concept is loosely defined on the basis of following parameters: disposable income, size of dwelling and affordability.</p>
        <p>
        There has been a considerable shift in focus wherein property developers are working towards providing for more and more affordable apartments for people. For a big chunk of the society, affordable homes are actual living dwellings, while for some, they are simply an investment option.</p>

        India&rsquo;s urban population is increasing manifold. Millions of young people are moving towards urban areas for better job prospects which in turn has led to increased pressure in the demand for more low cost, yet highly accessible space. More and more states of the country that are paving the way for urbanization are also working towards providing affordable homes to their inhabitants.</p>
        <p>
        Another contributing factor to the rise in affordable apartments is the rising income levels that have led to a sizeable middle class segment. The middle class segment is expected to be the primary audience for affordable housing projects.</p>
