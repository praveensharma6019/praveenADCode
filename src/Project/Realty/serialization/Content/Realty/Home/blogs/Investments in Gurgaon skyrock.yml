        Gurgaon is probably the most lucrative investment opportunity in NCR currently, due to the unique combination of its large, undeveloped land parcels and the fact that it is a burgeoning, cosmopolitan, commercial hub. It has become such a hot property that investors have been literally flocking to fund and buy projects there. In fact, investments in the area clocked a whopping $1 billion this year, which is a straight up doubling of the $500 million in investments in 2015. Land accounted for 42.55% of the total investment pie, followed by residential assets at 42.1%. Rented office properties brought in the smallest portion of the pie, registering only 15.3% of the total investment.</p>
