        <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #222222;"><strong><span style="background: #ffffff;">Andheri: The emerging corporate hub of Mumbai</span></strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
        <span style="font-size: 12pt; background: #ffffff; color: #000000;">From small settlements and businesses that belong to native East Indians, Andheri has come a long way to be known as the commercial hub of the metro city, Mumbai.&nbsp;Shedding the image of an industrial area, Andheri has transformed into a highly coveted and sought after residential and commercial location over the years. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
        <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;">Apart from SEEPZ and MIDC,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; background: #ffffff; color: #000000;"> it houses several regional and head offices of the who&rsquo;s who of the corporate world like banks &amp; financial services, media houses, film &amp; television production houses, IT companies and many more. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
        <span style="font-size: 12pt; background: #ffffff; color: #000000;">While Andheri does have some 20 to 50-year-old establishments, even the younger brigade of fresh and young entrepreneurs is tempted to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; background: #ffffff; color: #000000;">set up their start-ups here. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
        <span style="font-size: 12pt; background: #ffffff; color: #000000;">So, what are the factors that are influencing corporates to set up their base here? </span></p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
            <span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;"><strong>Best of both worlds</strong></span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 12pt; background: #ffffff; color: #000000;">In Andheri, everything you need is always close-by, plus it has good accessibility, with the metro station and Western Express Highway nearby. If you go downtown to South Mumbai, there&rsquo;s good connectivity, but the rents are too high.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">
        <span style="font-size: 12pt; background: #ffffff; color: #000000;">Similarly, Navi Mumbai is affordable, but accessibility is an issue. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.28cm; line-height: 108%;">

        <span style="font-size: 12pt; background: #ffffff; color: #000000;">Andheri boasts the perfect balance of accessibility and affordability. It is one of the best-connected suburbs in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, due to its proximity to Eastern &amp; Western Express Highways. The area also benefits immensely due to its closeness to other commercial hubs like Bandra Kurla Complex and Lower Parel. The metro railway running between Ghatkopar and Versova has further enhanced the appeal of this micro-market by easing the commute and reducing the burden on roads and railways. </span></p>
