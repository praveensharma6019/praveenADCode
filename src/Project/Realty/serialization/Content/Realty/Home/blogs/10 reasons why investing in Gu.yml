There are some pretty valid reasons why people are flocking in droves to invest their hard-earned money in buying properties in Gurgaon.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">

        <strong>Superb Civic Infrastructure:</strong> The robust civic infrastructure found in Gurugram makes it an attractive option for homebuyers and businesses alike. The city boasts of clean, wide roads and dozens of hospitals, schools, colleges, parks, and shopping areas. Moreover, being a relatively new city, the constructions are all still pretty new, so the whole city has a very spectacular, new-age feel to it.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Abundant Job Opportunities:</strong> Nearly 250 Fortune 500 companies have set up their base in Gurgaon. Global giants such as Coca-Cola, BMW, Pepsi etc. have their office spaces there. The excellent connectivity to Delhi, presence of top hotels and the closeness of the International Airport terminal, have led to it becoming Delhi&rsquo;s go-to zone for commercial office spaces.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Great Lifestyle Infrastructure:</strong> One can never run out of things to do at Gurgaon. A large number of very swank malls, fine dining restaurants, well manicured parks, pubs, gyms, popular entertainment zones and a spectacular golf course dot the landscape; adding to the international feel of the city.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Organized sectors:</strong> Gurgaon is a completely planned city. It is divided into multiple sectors, of which some are purely residential, some only commercial and some mixed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Education Hub:</strong> A good education is never far away if one chooses to settle in Gurgaon. The satellite city has become a hub of education in recent times. 6 leading management schools, 50 CBSE schools and 195 other government recognized schools and institutes, including top ranked institutions such as The Shri Ram School, Ardee World School, Pathways world schools etc. have set up centres there.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Well connected by all modes of transport:</strong> Gurgaon is well connected by all modes of transport including Air, Train, Metro, Buses, Taxis and also boasts a great ecosystem for travel and parking of Private transport.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Good Health Systems in place:</strong> You can be sure of medical assistance being close at hand no matter what the issue. Gurgaon is home to branches of some of the most technologically advanced medical institutions in the country. Some of these are Medanta Medicity, Paras Hospital, Artemis, Fortis, Columbia Asia and Max Hospital.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Homes of all price ranges available:</strong> Gurgaon has homes ranging from ultra luxury villas and penthouses, to comfort residences at budget rates. And the city itself isn&rsquo;t old. So no matter what your budget, you can be sure you will find a relatively new project to invest in. Adani Realty itself has built both Oyster Grande&nbsp; - a super luxury tower, and Aangan &ndash; a comfort project at affordable rates there.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Presence of leading Hospitality chains:</strong> The presence of famous hotels such as the Crowne Plaza, Leela Hotel, Oberoi, Double Tree by Hilton, Vivanta by Taj, Mariott, Trident and the Hyatt, is encouraging for tourism and a comfortable arrangement for high-class businessmen flying into the city for work.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
