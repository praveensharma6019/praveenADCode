        Second, it is a stone&rsquo;s throw away from the Airport, Bandra Terminus <em>and</em> Kurla terminus. And in addition to the suburban railway, the upcoming Line II of Phase 1 of the Mumbai Metro project will pass through the IFBC and will have 4 stations near and within BKC (MMRDA, Income Tax Office, Bharat Nagar and Complex Road).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        But best of all is the fact that BKC can also be easily accessed through the Western Express Highway, <em>and </em>the Eastern express highway. This makes it the best-connected area in the entire city - which is why multinationals and international firms are clambering over one another to acquire office space here.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Thirdly, BKC is home to fabulous hotels such as The Grand Hyatt, Sofitel and Trident hotels, among others. This makes it very easy for travelling business people, for whom commuting is something they&rsquo;d rather not waste time on.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        There are approximately 6 Lakh people working in various offices in BKC. The National Stock Exchange, SEBI, NABARD Head Office, IL&amp;FS, Amazon.com, Asian Heart Institute, Dow Chemicals, ICICI Bank, Citibank, Dena Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India, Bank of India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bharat Diamond Bourse, Unit Trust of India, Dhirubhai Ambani International School, American School of Bombay, Consulate of the United States and the Mumbai Cricket Association, all have their offices here.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Tech giant Apple is planning to set up office at the Maker Maxity complex in BKC soon.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The Demonetization drive doesn&rsquo;t seem to have hampered the commercial market in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Mumbai. In the past month, several office lease transactions have been concluded in the business district.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Australian analytics and data management software firm SAS is expected to be signing a lease deal of around 24,000 sq. ft. space at BKC, Qatar National Bank will be moving into an 8,000-sq-ft workspace, and Emirates Bank concluded a deal in the same complex, taking on lease 16,100 sq. ft. of prime BKC office space.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        American consultancy firm Gerson Lehrman Group also recently signed a lease deal for an 8,000 sq. ft., and Mattel Toys is shifting from Lower Parel to a 15,000 sq. ft. office space here. Two months ago, infrastructure company J Kumar also took on lease over 80,000 sq. ft.in the area.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        With Indian Real Estate experts Adani Realty giving finishing touches to one of their Gold Standard Commercial Complexes - &lsquo;Inspire Hub&rsquo; here, it seems like BKC&rsquo;s Business star power is here to stay.</p>
