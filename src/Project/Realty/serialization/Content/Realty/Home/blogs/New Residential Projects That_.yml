        <h3 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Redefining Pune&rsquo;s Best Neighborhoods </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Pune is a pool of opportunities and aspirations. The enormous growth in the education, business and IT sector have led to the rise in new and better employment openings. Fairly good infrastructure and quality of living have paved the way for new residential projects coming up in the buzzing parts of Pune city. </p>
        <p class="mb-4">The growing rate of Pune&rsquo;s property market has led to an increased number of residential projects, many of which are on the outskirts of the city, which are slowly but surely matching pace with the other sought after locations such as Koregaon Park and Kalyani Nagar. Over the years, Pune&rsquo;s realty sector has extended in all directions, making it one of the best cities to invest. </p>
        <p class="mb-4">If there is one popular and plush neighbourhood that has not deterred over the years, it is Koregaon Park. It is among the most sought after locations to reside in, especially for those who wish to invest on a long-term basis. The elite status and luxury style of living are well known among all age groups. Initially developed as a garden locality, Koregaon Park slowly ventured out and gained a new dimension as the most desirable neighbourhood to reside in. </p>
        <p class="mb-4">Widely known for its buzzing ambience, Koregaon Park is home to a variety of restaurants, hotels and boutiques, which contribute to the upscale living of this neighbourhood. From luxurious apartments to villas and bungalows, the residential scenario is extremely homely and ideal for young couples and growing families. The upcoming projects in Pune predominantly want to find their addresses in Koregaon Park, thanks to its opulent lifestyle that includes a self-sufficient neighbourhood with all modern day lifestyle amenities. </p>
        <p class="mb-4">With the increasing emergence of <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue"> <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=C8D0652672864FF8888EA2D2E60710C7&amp;_z=z">residential projects in Koregaon Park</a>&nbsp;</strong> and other neighbourhoods like Boat Club Road, Viman Nagar and Kalyani Nagar, top builders in Pune are catering to this rise in demand with luxurious projects that offer suave lifestyle amenities, such as advanced security systems, power supply backup, indoor and outdoor recreational facilities, air-conditioned homes and spectacular views. </p>
        <p class="mb-4">The perks of living in these neighbourhoods are multifold, and with Adani Realty, it&rsquo;s nothing less of a dream come true. Atelier Greens is the perfect spot for anyone who wishes to live close to nature with its vertical garden fa&ccedil;ade, alongside having access to the best of facilities ranging from two clubhouses, gymnasium, Vaastu compliance, East-West facing apartments and much more, all of which make it a great choice. Such projects and neighbourhoods have space and infrastructure to support the modern-day amenities offered within the property premises. They also appeal to different family sizes and different budgets, but most importantly, can support the growing population of Pune and their lifestyle preferences.</p>
