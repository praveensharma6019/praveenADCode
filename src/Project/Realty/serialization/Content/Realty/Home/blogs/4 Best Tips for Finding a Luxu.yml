        <strong>4 Best Tips for Finding a Luxury Property in Gurgaon</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm; text-align: justify;">
        Gurgaon, the millennium city, is a hub for plush corporate offices, elegant malls, vibrant nightlife and upscale residential buildings. While buying a &lsquo;luxury home&rsquo; in Gurgaon can truly be an exhilarating experience, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean buying the most expensive house in town. Of course, it involves a good deal of money, as when it comes to luxury homes, you&rsquo;re primarily looking at the cr&egrave;me-de-la-cr&egrave;me of housing residences with an element of elitism.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm; text-align: justify;">
        While Gurgaon is home to some of the best properties to choose from, not every residence falls under the &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; segment. If you&rsquo;re looking for a real luxury property, here are a few essential elements that should be considered that will help you find a perfect living environment and elevate your lifestyle for years to come.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;">
        <strong>Tips for finding a Luxury Property</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;">
            <strong>Find the Right Locality:</strong></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.35cm; text-align: justify;">
        Selecting a posh locality is one of the most important parameters when it comes to investing in luxury homes. A property close to a vibrant suburb, to multiple conveniences and offering a peaceful environment can essentially be tagged as &lsquo;luxury&rsquo;. An exclusive view of the city can always be admired. A prime locality will get early access to infra upgrades and witness significant development that is the key to future price appreciation in the area.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.35cm; text-align: justify;">
        <br />
        &nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;">
            <strong>Go with a Reputed Developer:</strong></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.35cm; text-align: justify;">
        An established developer with a good track record will never compromise with quality and ensure timely delivery of the promises made. The projects from an established developer will always feature the best architecture and latest amenities that offer a world-class living experience. Being an established name in the real estate market, the developer will have financial stability that ensures the quality of construction while reducing the chances of fraud to near zero, and hence, it is important to go with a project that is being developed by a reputed developer.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.35cm; text-align: justify;">
        <br />
        &nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;">
            <strong>Understand the Basics of Real Estate Investing</strong>:</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.35cm; text-align: justify;">
        Once you&rsquo;ve narrowed down your selections, it is necessary to check for several approvals such as the title of ownership, RERA Registration of the Project, plan layout approvals from Municipal Corporation, building-use permission once the construction work is complete, etc. Additionally, it is also important to ensure that there is no super-built up cost involved in the total cost of ownership as a buyer is only liable to pay for the actual usable area of the apartment. All these details while ensuring customer safety will ensure a smooth transfer of property.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.35cm;">
        <br />
        &nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;">
            <strong>Look for Exclusiveness:</strong></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 1.27cm; margin-bottom: 0.35cm; text-align: justify;">
        Exclusiveness is a key element when it comes to finding a luxury property. A project with the most basic amenities doesn&rsquo;t mean &lsquo;luxury&rsquo;. The exclusiveness of a property might depend on the number of families residing in the society. A lower number ensures a low sharing ratio and better availability of the amenities. It can additionally depend on exclusive views or super-rich amenities such as Italian marble flooring, a rooftop swimming pool, Jacuzzi and hot tub, open and landscaped spaces etc. It should also feature large living spaces and offer a truly luxurious living experience, the very basic ingredient of a luxury home.</p>
