        <strong>10 simple hacks to keep your house cool in the summer</strong></p>
        <p>
        Indian summers are infamous for the intense heat they bring with them, which can even prove fatal. To survive this blistering heat, we try umpteen home cooling tricks to cool our homes naturally. As temperatures rise, most of us resort to keeping our homes cool by using air conditioners. The irony is, this not only drains our pockets, but we&rsquo;re also burning enough fossil fuel, making the world a hotter place.</p>
        <p>
        Fortunately, we have a few smart yet simple home cooling ideas for the summer which can cool your home without leaving a huge carbon footprint or burning a hole in your pocket.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>Be a fan of table fans</strong><br />
            Out of all the summer home tips, this one is probably the easiest and most affordable. All you need are three things which are already there in your home: a fan, large metal bowl, and ice. Keep the fan on, the bowl of ice in front of it, and let the ice cubes work their magic. Even after the cubes melt, the cool water left behind continues to cool the room.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Light it right</strong><br />
            Turn off lights when they are not in use &ndash; especially incandescent bulbs as they tend to heat up the house. It&rsquo;s best to replace them with cooler light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or compact fluorescents (CFLs).</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Cotton is king</strong><br />
            This summer tip for the home will never fail you. Ditch the fancy satin, silk or faux leather upholstery and invest in crisp cotton bedsheets, in white or pastel shades. If your couch is upholstered in any fabric that&rsquo;s not cotton or linen, buy some sofa covers or throws that are made of cotton.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Plant some shade</strong><br />
            If you have some large decorative or potted plants around, move them closer to your windows. They will absorb most of the heat and create a cooling effect around them. If not, then there&rsquo;s no better time than summer to start planting!</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Cook wisely</strong><br />
            This is the perfect time for grills. Chuck the stove and make ample use of the outdoors in the evenings. Call your friends over for a grill party. Preferably use the microwave before the heat picks up in the day.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Cross-ventilate</strong><br />
            One of the easiest home cooling tricks in summer is to keep your doors ajar, including the main door. This causes the stagnant hot air to be replenished and keeps the fresh air circulated throughout the building. Also, remember to leave the exhaust fans switched on during the day.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Keep things dark</strong><br />
            Keep the curtains drawn shut, right from the morning. If your room stays shielded from sunlight all day, it is bound to remain relatively cooler. To achieve this, buy cotton curtains in the darkest shade possible- preferably go in for dark green or brown.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Dehumidify</strong><br />
            If you live in an area with lots of humidity, you sweat, and it doesn't evaporate. Instead, it soaks your clothes leaving you feeling wet, sticky, and miserable. One home cooling trick is to invest in a dehumidifier. It reduces the humidity around, and you&rsquo;ll breathe much easier.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Declutter</strong><br />
            Too many heavy furnitures kept close to each other can create 'hot air pockets'. Any kind of clutter in the house traps the hot air, and it becomes stagnant. So create as much room as possible for the air to keep circulating.</li>
            <li>
            <strong>Sleep Low</strong><br />
            When the heat rises,&nbsp;hit the downstairs couch&nbsp;or basement, or put your mattress on the floor if the air feels cooler down there.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        <em>Lastly, remember that it&rsquo;s not just about finding the best summer tips for your home but also for your body. This is the time to indulge in those yummy milkshakes and smoothies. So drink up as many liquids as you can. </em></p>
