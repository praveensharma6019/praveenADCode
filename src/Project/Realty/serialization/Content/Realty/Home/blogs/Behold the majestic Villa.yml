        With the frenzy surrounding the city life, it has become hard to find homes that give you the freedom of enjoying a peaceful yet luxurious life. The concept of Independent Housing (Villas), which is quite popular in the U.S. and Europe, is slowly gaining prominence in India. While metro cities struggle to accommodate the ever-growing population, smaller cities have the privilege of providing larger spaces to build ostentatious homes! Seen as one of the best investment options today, these palatial homes are the ultimate form of self-indulgence today. More and more people are opting to live in standalone homes (villas) and make a statement about their arrival in life.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Away from the hectic pace of big city life</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The humdrum of city life often leaves us searching for a place that offers peace and serenity; a place where we can enjoy the smallest of things and revel in the little pleasures of life. Like waking up to the sounds of a dozen different kinds of birds. Or sitting for hours on your porch, sipping tea and reading and listening to your favourite music. Or hosting an evening barbeque for family and friends. The dream is to live a peaceful life away from the chaos. Only a villa can give you this degree of luxury.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Better lifestyle</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Villas are usually located in closed, friendly neighbourhoods and peaceful surroundings. The abundant greenery, the kiss of nature&rsquo;s purity and the calming environment provide for a modest and relaxed life.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personalized Comfort and luxury</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Villas are usually very spacious, equipped with modern amenities, and furnished with elegant and contemporary decor. The rooms are dramatically large and opulent, and a lot of furniture and accessories can be accommodated. Modular kitchens take over conventional kitchen spaces. Access to facilities like spas, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and clubhouses is almost always assured. The large spaces make all kinds of modifications possible. From having a personal gym in your room, to planning a swimming pool that rests within the boundaries of your home; the possibilities of personalizing every corner of your home are endless.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your second home</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        While there are people who love the frenetic pace of city life, there are a large majority who dream of nothing more, than to live a more comfortable and relaxed life. And who wouldn't like to break away from the mundane? For people like this, villas are the ideal vacation homes. Usually built away from the heart of the city, they provide the perfect escape, to both families and stressed out professionals alike.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good appreciation value</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Villas are modelled to define ultra-luxury living. They hold high market value, and that is why their prices almost never go down. They are a great investment option, as their prices remain more or less unaffected even when the market is slug.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Independent housing/Villa living, is popular in cities like Pune, Gurgaon, Ahmedabad, Bangalore etc, that let you enjoy an easy-going lifestyle by virtue of the larger spaces available for relatively cheaper. A lot of developers are moving towards marking their presence in these cities that let them play with expansive spaces.
