        <p><span>Pune is gradually turning into a city of high-rises, credits to the increasing flurry of real estate activity by some esteemed developers like Adani Realty, who aim to transform the city&rsquo;s skyline.</span></p>
        <p>Some of the many critical trends that are causing the real estate boom in Pune are:</p>
        <ul class="ul-bullets">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">An alternative to Mumbai</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> &ndash; When house-hunting in and around Mumbai, </span><span>o<span style="color: black;">ne </span>may<span style="color: black;"> venture into places beyond Virar, Badlapur, or even Panvel to buy a 2BHK or 3BHK flat. However, at the same rate in Pune, a luxurious apartment is easily affordable that too in some of the best locations. This has led to the top builders in Pune to invest in residential projects in Koregaon Park and other notable locations in the city.</span></span></li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">Locational advantages</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> &ndash; </span><span>The Pune airport is expanding at a tremendous pace, making it easier for people to travel to different cities and regions, due to which many prefer living closer to the airport for convenience and to avoid traffic. As a result, much of the<span style="color: black;"> real estate activity is also taking place in the airport vicinity.</span></span></li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">Big locations, big players</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> &ndash; </span><span>Areas<span style="color: black;"> like Mundhwa, Rajgurunagar, and Koregaon Park are proving to be the cradle for real estate activity and have led </span>to the<span style="color: black;"> entry of stalwarts like Adani Realty with their upcoming projects in Pune. Similarly, areas around the Pune Nagar Road are also gaining </span>popularity<span style="color: black;">. </span></span></li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">Growth</span><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);"> of industries</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> - Today, every industrialist worth his salt is opening manufacturing units </span><span>in and around the city<span style="color: black;">. Areas like Talegaon and Chakan are witnessing tremendous growth in manufacturing industries. The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) is also playing its part in facilitating the setting up of enterprises</span> here<span style="color: black;">. Naturally,</span> the sprawling city <span style="color: black;">is witnessing a gradual change and is </span>emerging as a<span style="color: black;"> preferred place for investing in real estate. With the flourishing industrial ground, people are looking forward to buying </span><strong><a href="https://www.adanirealty.com/codenamegreens/code-name-greens">flats in Pune</a></strong><span style="color: black;">.</span></span></li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">Blend of culture and modernity</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> &ndash; Despite being one of the most literate and culturally advanced cities in Maharashtra</span><span>, Pune continues to retain <span style="color: black;">the rustic charm of being a predominantly Marathi bastion. </span>The city has lately been experiencing an upsurge of migrants from various states, especially from South India and also foreigners. <span style="color: black;">Therefore, Pune presents the perfect blend of cultural heritage and the modernity of life.</span></span></li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">Adani Realty</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> &ndash; After a successful stint with various prestigious </span><span><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=62716968A1054C20A69EE326D93F4013&amp;_z=z"><strong><span>projects in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and other places</span></strong></a></span><span style="color: black;">, Adani is all set with one in Pune and that too in Koregaon Park. Expect high quality construction and amenities to the best of your imagination.</span></li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong><span style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">Expectations of the new generation</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> &ndash; </span><span>Numerous <span style="color: black;">IT companies and MNCs operate here. </span>Those <span style="color: black;">working in these sectors have a higher disposable income</span> whereby they <span style="color: black;">expect a specific standard of living. The new residential projects in Pune aim to address such needs by providing the highest degree of luxury and comfort.</span></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The complete overhauling of the real estate landscape and redefining of luxury will go a long way towards making Pune bloom with a great number of high-rises.&nbsp;</p>
