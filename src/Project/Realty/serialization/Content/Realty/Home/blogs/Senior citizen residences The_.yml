        There is a steadily growing community of retirees today, who are opting to move to peaceful, less polluted areas that offer all the comforts of home, along with the security of an assisted facility and the comfort and companionship of living alongside other seniors.</p>
        <p>
        Afterall, we all earn for a good livelihood. For a life that we deserve. To provide ourselves with the comfort that we need. And most importantly to save for our old age that we trust with no one but ourselves. Along with passing age, our lives slow down too. As our age progresses, we yearn for a life that is simple and uncomplicated. We yearn to live around people alike. To live a life stress-free and without any troubles.We all dream of having a senior-citizen home where we can finally settle down in the latter days of our life. Catering to these needs, a lot of real estate developers are coming up with the concept of senior citizen homes and senior citizen housing projects that are stand-alone projects or a part of larger integrated townships.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%.

        From medically trained staff on call, to staff doctors, infirmaries and in-house ambulances, these new age retirement homes leave no stone unturned to ensure the safety of their residents.</p>
        <p>
        Residents are encouraged to come together as a community, and keep themselves physically active and mentally engaged in their areas of interest, so as to prevent boredom related psychological symptoms from setting in, as is frequent with many retirees..</p>
        <p>
        All day-to-day concerns like plumbers, electricians, cooks etc., are taken care of by the facility, so that seniors can finally lead the hassle free life they deserve after all their years of hard work and stress. There are also in-house cafeterias where residents can opt to eat their meals together if they so wish. Annual or monthly maintenance fees take care of all these services and more. These senior citizen housing projects look after every small need of the residents ensuring a comfortable life for them.</p>

        Some retirement homes such as The Evergreen, by Adani Realty, which is coming up as part of the Shantigram Township on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, come with a host of lifestyle facilities.</p>

        The Evergreen will have its own Physiotherapy centre, wheelchair access to all parts of the facility, anti-skid flooring, emergency alarm systems, a gymnasium, hobby rooms, a coffee and access to The Belvedere Golf and Country Club, besides all the other usual facilities.</p>
        <p>
        Retirement homes like these are not to be confused with old-age homes where seniors live in a room as a patient. Here, seniors own their own homes within the complex, and yet, receive all the care and facilities that they could possible need and want. Seniors find this a great arrangement as they have all the freedom to live as they want, without having to feel like guests in their married children&rsquo;s homes. Many people who currently live in senior communities swear by it, saying that the joy of having people your own age for companionship is unparalleled. It&rsquo;s no wonder then that Retirement Homes are getting known as the best retirement plan for one&rsquo;s old age!</p>
