        Modular kitchens have transformed the way we think of the humble kitchen; glamming it up and making it a place where you don&rsquo;t just cook, but also unwind and spend time with family. They provide an edge to the kitchen, and you can customise them any way you want depending on the specific aesthetic or functionality you desire.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        As the name suggests, Modular kitchens are based on the concept of &lsquo;modularity&rsquo;, which means dividing into smaller parts. Modular kitchen sets include space saving modular furniture, cabinets, drawers, pullout trays, chimneys, hobs, storage systems and many other units that help drive multiple functionalities together.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong>These are the benefits of a modular kitchen:</strong></p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        Cooking is easier in a modular kitchen because everything, right from utensils to condiments are right at hand in well-defined drawers/cabinets. The sink and shopping area are also a part of the same unit, making cooking a faster exercise overall. And when you have completed your cooking for the day, you can wind up the mess within minutes.</p>

        All in all, Modular kitchens are a great bet for modern day apartments. There are houses that offer the inbuilt modular kitchen. Or you can even install one in an existing non-modular kitchen setup.</p>
