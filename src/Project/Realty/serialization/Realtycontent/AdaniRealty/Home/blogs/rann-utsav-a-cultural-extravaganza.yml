        <strong>Every year, from November to February, the Kutch Region comes alive when a tent city is constructed in the open desert of Dhordo.</strong> </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Ahmedabad, or Amdavad, as locals call it, is the largest and most popular city in Gujarat. It is a bustling metropolis that offers enough and more to travellers from all walks of life. It is India's first UNESCO World Heritage City. One of the most popular tourist spots in the city is Adalaj Vav, or Adalaj Stepwell, located right outside the city in Adalaj Village, Gandhinagar District. Queen Rudadevi had this 15<sup>th</sup> -century marvel constructed in the memory of her husband Rana Veer Singh. It's a great example of the Solanki style of architecture and is made of sandstone. It has intricately designed pillars placed octagonally and is five stories deep.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Another historic spot in Ahmedabad is the Gandhi Ashram, also known as Sabarmati Ashram. It is located on the banks of the Sabarmati River and is known for being one of the residences of Mahatma Gandhi. It is from this Ashram that Gandhiji led the Dandi March in 1930. Today this place serves as a museum and celebrates the life of the Father of the Nation. Among other famous attractions is the Kankariya Lake, which has many touristy attractions that make for an idyllic combination to spend the evening. Another place on the list is the Sabarmati Riverfront, a 10 km long two-level promenade along the Sabarmati River. It features a walking as well as a cycling track and has elevator access, seating arrangements and boating. </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        If you want to witness the city's most happening place, you must visit<strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web-dev.uat.adanirealty.com/township/shantigram-ahmedabad" target="_blank"> Shantigram, one of the largest integrated townships in Gujarat</a></strong>. It is built over approximately 600 acres and has everything from residential projects to commercial &amp; retail spaces and a social club. Its dedicated pedestrian path, green areas, a 7-acre lake with one of India's Largest Musical Aqua Shows, and promenade alongside the Golf Course offer enough and more to residents and visitors alike. <strong>Adani Shantigram</strong>, built and developed by<strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web-dev.uat.adanirealty.com/" target="_blank"> Adani Realty</a></strong>, is one of the most sought-after addresses for businesses and families looking for a space to call their own. </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        From ancient stepwells, forts and mosques to the craft villages, festive celebrations and modern cities, Gujarat truly is home to some of the best and most unique experiences. Gujarat was one of the most well-known sites during the Indus Valley Civilization, with ancient cities of Lothal, Dholavira and Gola Dhoro situated here. Lothal is believed to be one of the first ports in India.  </p>
        <p class="mb-2">One of the most diverse states in India, Gujarat offers a lot more than the average traveller expects. While the state is widely known for its Navratri celebrations and the <strong>Rann Utsav</strong>, many other experiences are intrinsic to Gujarat. It won't be an exaggeration to say that historically and culturally, Gujarat is one of the richest states. </p>
        <p class="mb-2">Gujarat has a unique culture and heritage reflected beautifully in the many art and craft forms that thrive within the state. These tell the story of present-day Gujarat and the influences it has had over the last 2000 years or so from other states and countries. </p>
        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Rann Utsav</strong> is one of the most colourful celebrations in India. Tent City, the makeshift city for the festivities, is just 88 KM from Bhujodi. This makeshift city holds within itself a world of its own. From local cuisines to craft items to dance and music performances, the Rann Utsav represents Gujarat in the sincerest way possible. Once here, remember to capture the grandiose of the place from the outside. It looks less like a city and more like a palace, with glitter and gleam in every corner. </p>
        <p class="mb-2">Spend time exploring all that makes this place a must-visit on every traveller's list. For all the foodies out there, this place has separate tents just for food that offers various dishes and cuisines. Additionally, there are separate shopping areas that display craft items presented by artisans from different parts of the state. So, you can literally shop till you drop!</p>
        <p class="mb-2">Do take some time in the evening and drive towards the white salt desert to witness a mesmerising sunset before returning to the tent city to participate in the dance and music performances that will leave us enthralled. </p>
        <p class="mb-2">In the vicinity lay several villages that are home to the artists who bring to life art and craft items like silverware, wooden items, clothes, footwear, mirror-work pieces and plenty more. Visiting these places is a wonderful chance to meet the artisans, watch them hard at work, and purchase some of these pieces to bring home. </p>
        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Rann Utsav</strong> is one of India's most culturally vibrant festivals and should be a part of your travel itinerary to experience Gujarat at its colourful and vibrant best. </p>
