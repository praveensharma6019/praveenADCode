        The world&rsquo;s tallest tower and most prestigious residential address is the Burj Khalifa, located in Dubai. Its design is derived from a pattern embodied in the form of Islamic architecture, which has a great element of history and culture in the region.

The building is also designed with a cladding system, to withstand the unbearable heat in Dubai during summers, and also has its own condensation management system which sustainably produces over a million gallons of water annually.</p>
