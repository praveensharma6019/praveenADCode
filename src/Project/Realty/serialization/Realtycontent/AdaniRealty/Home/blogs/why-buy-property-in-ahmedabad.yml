        The upcoming areas with promising residential and commercial projects in Ahmedabad are beaming with all the facilities that you require for your future investment. One of the major concerns for any prospective buyer is connectivity. The newly developed housing and commercial infrastructure around the SG (Sarkhej-Gandhinagar) Highway ensures that roads and flyovers are smoothly operating on this road. It serves as the link between Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar&ndash;its twin city and the state&rsquo;s capital. Plus, the recently constructed 2.36-km-long elevated corridor between the Gota Flyover and the Science City Flyover has further reduced the travelling time of daily commuters from Ahmedabad to the capital city by linking it to junctions like Sola Bhagwat, Janata Nagar, Kargil Petrol Pump, and Zydus Hospital.Therefore, more and more people are investing in luxury and budget-friendly apartments in Ahmedabad.</p>
