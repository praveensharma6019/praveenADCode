        <p class="mb-2">
        Getting back to the monsoon, there is no denying the fact that this season causes maximum damage to your home. The most affected by the downpour, are the walls of your house. Leakages, cracks, mould, fungus, etc., can be nightmares for any homemaker even if it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://web-dev.uat.adanirealty.com/residential-projects/mumbai/the-views">luxury apartment in Mumbai</a>.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        It is very important to safeguard your&nbsp;house&nbsp;from the moisture and humidity while monsoons are around, to ensure that you don&rsquo;t end up needing major home repairs.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">So, refer to this handy guide to protect your home from the monsoons this year. </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Water leakages:</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Keep a check of cracks in walls and ceilings which leads to water seeping from outside and later leads to fungal growth. &nbsp;To protect walls from damage, apply a good quality coat of paint and sealant, or if possible add a coat of waterproofer on the external side of the house to safeguard it.</p>
        <p class="mb-2"><strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Check water pipelines:</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Make sure that all the pipes are free from cracks and if you spot any of them, seal them as soon as possible. Also make sure that the pipes are not clogged with any dust or waste.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Say no to termites!!</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Generally, termites grow in a moist and humid environment. Keep a note of your furniture and ensure everything made of wood is properly polished to avoid fungus.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Save the wooden doors:</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Use sandpaper to scale down the swelling of the wooden doors, cabinets and wooden furniture. Also, oiling will prevent your wooden door and furniture from swelling, and wax will protect hardwood from excess moisture.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Keep your home airy and open:</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Ensure there is cross-ventilation in the house. Use air-conditioners or dehumidifier to keep your house moist free. But if you don&rsquo;t have any of it, use natural sunlight to get rid of the moisture in the room.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Postpone washing: </strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        In the rainy season, carpets are prone to getting smelly and damaged. So the best thing to do is to roll them up and keep them in a dry place till the monsoon ends. &nbsp;In case they are made of silk or any other expensive materials, use silicon bags and roll it up. If in any case, it is not possible to roll up the carpets and rugs, make sure that they do not get wet.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <em>Remember, </em><em>the monsoon is a season to enjoy. Take proper measures to thwart the effects on your home and you can make the most of this beautiful season.</em></p>
