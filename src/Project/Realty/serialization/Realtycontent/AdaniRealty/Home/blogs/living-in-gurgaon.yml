        A city that barely existed three decades ago, Gurgaon (Gurugram) now has become a corporate city and is also home to over 15 lakh people. Inclusive of shopping malls, golf courses, luxury shops and automobile showrooms of Mercedes-Benzes and BMW, and a futuristic commercial hub called Cyber City, it houses many of the world's most respected corporations.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">
        The Past and The Present:</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
        However, before it had malls, theme parks and fancy housing compounds, Gurgaon&rsquo;s prized asset was cattle. It was a farming village whose name was derived from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, meaning "village of the gurus.&rdquo; The village was owned by the Pandavas and the Kauravas. They gifted the land to their master or teacher, Guru Dronacharya, and the land came to be known as Gurugram. With the passage of time, the name was gradually distorted and the present day name is, Gurgaon. However recently in 2016, the Chief Minister of Haryana announced a proposal to officially name the city Gurugram again. If you turn the pages of history, you will find that the place was once under the Mughal Empire, followed by the British Raj, but till date, you can still see the original village of Gurgaon, amidst rapid urbanization and globalization.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">
        The Rise of the Economic Hub</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The city of Gurgaon has for long been a bellwether of the rapid growth in the country over the years, thanks to the presence of multiple multinational corporations. It was in the 1970&rsquo;s that saw Maruti Suzuki make its way into the city, as it was the first company to establish a manufacturing plant in the district. Later on in 1997, General Electric became the first American company to set up a unit in the city, with several other multinationals following. However, the Maruti Suzuki plant in 1983 became a significant turning point in Gurgaon&rsquo;s economy.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Today, Gurgaon is one of India's fastest-growing districts, having expanded more than 70 percent during the past decade to more than 1.5 million people, more extensive than most American cities. It accounts for almost half of all revenue for its state, Haryana, and has become a roaring engine of growth, if also a colossal headache as a place to live and work. The steep increase of population during 2001 and 2011 indicates large-scale in-migration of people from neighbouring states in particular. This has been mainly due to the work opportunities generated. The initial opportunities were that of the Maruti plant in the 1980s, followed by additional plants coming up. At the end of the 1990s and beginning of 2000, there was a large number of call centers, BPOs, KPOs &ndash; all working in shifts with a lot of cabs, thus not only generating in-office jobs but also jobs for drivers, guards. It was followed by IT companies and other corporate office jobs coming up, causing a large number of families to move into the city along with the inflow of low income generating jobs. These included jobs such as security guards, maids, servants, drivers etc. This has further led to a series of businesses coming up and positions within them, along with the demand for low paying job services.</p>

        The Famous Spots which make up the Urban Gurgaon</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Gurgaon has also got a distinct &lsquo;urban personality&rsquo; due to its increase in size and along with that, a change in its cultural composition. The flavour of Gurgaon in terms of population has become very diverse as it encompasses people from all over the globe. The same is also visible in some practices and celebrations in the city. Here all the festivals are celebrated at the community level, be it Navratri or Diwali or Holi or Durga Puja as people from different ethnic backgrounds reside here. Not only this, but children also celebrate Halloween and Christmas as the culture is genuinely global here.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Having come a long way from being just another commercial hub, Gurgaon is now dotted with a host of attractions that will enthrall you and your kids with a plethora of entertaining and educational activities. From larger-than-life musicals at Kingdom of Dreams and ice skating rings at iSkate to swirling water rides at Oysters Water Park, these are just few of the places.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Located close to Delhi, Gurgaon is not only a place for commerce, business and high-class entertainment, but it is also an expanding area for world cuisine, attracting visitors from all over India. Astonishingly diverse, multi-cultural and captivating, the city offers a wide range of restaurant options, from the budget-friendly indulgences at Sardar Jalebi Wala and Bombay Best Paav Bhaaji to classy dining at Coriander Leaf and 56 Ristorante.</p>
