        While first-time investors prefer to stay safe and invest in residential real estate, Commercial Real Estate tends to attract investors who have a greater understanding and experience with the subtleties of the realty market.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        All investors must analyze numerous factors before making their investments. These factors vary, depending upon whether the investment is made in a 
        <a href="/commercial-projects">commercial property</a> or a residential one.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Commercial spaces offer greater liquidity in the investment, as compared to residential properties. But on the flip side, the funds required to invest in a commercial property, are usually much higher than those required for a residential space. And these higher stakes are what keep the smaller fish at bay.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        <ol>
            <li class="mb-2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">How well is the sector your business runs within, doing in that area? What other Businesses are predominant in the area? Having allied businesses around is an asset.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you are in the business of fresh and dry flowers and bouquets, having Hospitals around or an Airport nearby would mean great business!</li>
            <li class="mb-2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">Does the Location have good&nbsp;access to public transport, citizen amenities and other infrastructure that your employees and customers will require? For example, it would make no sense to open a car garage along a one-lane road that&rsquo;s always packed with traffic.&nbsp;</li>
            <li class="mb-2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">Is the location easily accessible to residential areas? Will your employees and customers be able to reach you easily? Many a good business has failed because the premises were just too far off from civilization!</li>
            <li class="mb-2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">What are the growth prospects for your rental income? A higher rental prospect always translates to a higher initial property price.</li>
            <li class="mb-2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">What is your exact requirement? Different requirements need different approaches. For example, bigger units usually pay off better in the long run. Pre-leased assets help generate revenue immediately.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mb-2">
