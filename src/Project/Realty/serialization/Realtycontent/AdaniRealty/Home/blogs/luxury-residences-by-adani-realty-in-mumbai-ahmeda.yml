        Popular cities that are home to Adani Realty Luxury Residences<br />
        <br />
        India has one of the fastest growing real markets in the world, in which the luxury segment is emerging as one of the most zestful segments. According to Moneycontrol, market analysts indicate that India would require 1.5 million luxury homes over the next 15 years, keeping in mind the high demand for luxury homes. Which is not wrong because as of today, luxury real estate is not only flourishing in Tier 1 cities but also in Tier 2 cities.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        These cities are termed to be as &lsquo;Popular cities&rsquo; basis of how they stack up in &lsquo;Life at work&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;Life after work&rsquo;. Often, cities that score high in one index fare rather average on the other. Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad are making quite an exception to that and hence, our&nbsp;luxury apartments in Mumbai,&nbsp;Gurgaon and Ahmedabad are developed in the best locations in these cities, in such a way, that the residents enjoy great proximity to places of entertainment, schools, hospitals and transport hubs.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        All our apartments come with facilities that you can enjoy unrestricted access to. The mesmerising view of landscaped gardens, azure skies, infinity swimming pools, sports courts, jogging tracks, swanky gymnasiums, and meditation plazas to experience oneness with nature; are just some of the amenities that we have to offer at our properties.<br />
        <br />
