        The <strong>Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority </strong>(referred to as <strong>RERA Maharashtra </strong> or <strong>MahaRERA</strong>) is a governing and regulatory authority overseeing real estate buying and selling in the state of Maharashtra. In
        other words, MahaRERA makes sure that real estate transactions are transparent and fair for buyers as well as real estate developers.
        </p>
        <h2 class="mb-3">When did RERA Maharashtra (MahaRERA) come about?</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The real estate industry has been booming in every corner of the country. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, was brought into force to provide a level playing field for real estate developers across the nation. It also has several features that provide a sense of fairness and security to buyers of both residential and commercial properties.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Most Indian states have their own RERA board to oversee the development of their real estate sector. <strong>MahaRERA</strong> is one such board that operates in the state of Maharashtra. RERA Maharashtra came about to take steps in promoting and regulating the development of realty in the state. Maharashtra is among the first Indian states to implement RERA, and its main objective is to bring about transparency in the buying and selling of plots and buildings, both residential and commercial.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        It is mandatory for every residential and commercial project to be registered under MahaRERA.
