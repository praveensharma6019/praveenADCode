        Despite legal hurdles and other issues, the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) has managed to complete a large part of the ongoing Northern Peripheral Road (NPR), also known as the Dwarka Expressway in its Gurgaon phase.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        However the Delhi part of NPR is going to take some time to complete.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Around 18km of the 27km-long NPR passes through Gurgaon. The remaining 9km is in the Delhi side. While work on the Gurgaon side is almost complete, the remaining portion will only near completion around March 2017. Land acquisition has only just begun in Delhi.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        In order to reduce the load on NH-8 and develop better connectivity between the Capital and its business outpost Guragon, the Haryana government is pushing hard to make operational a 4.5-kilometer, 4-lane road between Bajghera in Gurgaon and Bijwasan in Delhi.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        People with real estate projects along NPR are likely to benefit from the project as real estate prices escalate. It will also reduce traffic on NH-8, as people from Delhi can directly go to Manesar or Jaipur without touching NH-8.</p>
