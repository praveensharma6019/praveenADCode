        Mumbai &ndash; the city of dreams, is one of the largest, most bustling cities of the world. Every year, the island city welcomes millions of people, who end up making this city their own. Some rent apartments; some invest in affordable homes; and some go on to build palaces. If you haven&rsquo;t invested in your dream home in Mumbai yet, here&rsquo;s why this city should be your next address!</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%.

        Mumbai is home to a very cosmopolitan crowd. From people who are guided by religious beliefs and traditions, to people who look up to the western culture-embracing it as their way of living, this city has a dream for everyone. The melting pot of traditions and cultures makes Mumbai one of the most vibrant and fun cities of India.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">3. The admirable undying spirit of locals </h3>
        <p class="mb-2">It&rsquo;s not just the environment we live in that&rsquo;s important. The neighbourhood that we live in, the people we surround ourselves with, and the company that we keep, all add up to the life we make for ourselves. Mumbaikars are extremely warm and welcoming. The warmhearted and welcoming nature makes them easily approachable. Whether you want to experience the nightlife of this beautiful city or try some of the most lip smacking delicacies at the most popular eateries, you can always turn to the locals for good advice.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">4. Hub of good educational institutions and MNCs</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">Over the past few years, the financial capital of the country has become home to an astounding number of educational institutions and various MNCs. The film and media industries are here, the IT industry, the fashion industry, and various financial companies are headquartered here too, thus creating large employment opportunities. As per a report by The Economic Times, nearly 4500 startups were registered in 2015 alone!</p>
        <h3 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">5. Make way for smart homes</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">Life in a cosmopolitan city is far different and progressive than other cities around the country. Homes here are equipped with world-class technology and fancy fittings. The appliances are user-friendlier and appeal to the tech-savvy audience. The interiors are done to match pace with the transforming lifestyle of city folk, and classic artifacts find their way into the homes of art connoisseurs. Smart homes are built to match the progressive lifestyles of people.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">6. Excellent connectivity that eases transportation woes</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">Every part of Mumbai enjoys great road network and connectivity. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s never difficult to find a mode of transport to travel to your preferred destination. Almost 88 percent of Mumbai&rsquo;s population thrives on the wide network of the excellent public transport that the city boasts of.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        All in all, the energetic nightlife, the benevolent nature of the Mumbaikars, and the speedy development that the city is witnessing, make it one of the most favourable cities of the nation. Some of the most mesmerizing attractions like the Queens&rsquo;s Necklace, The Gateway of India and the beautiful cityscape are something to die for.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The exponentially growing city is one of the biggest cities in the world with an even bigger heart. For everyone who&rsquo;s come to this city that offers so much love, it&rsquo;s just as hard to turn their backs and go!</p>
