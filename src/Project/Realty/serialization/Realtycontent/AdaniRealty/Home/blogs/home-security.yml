        We are all fiercely protective of our loved ones. Right from our children to our aging parents whose defense mechanisms grow weaker as they age, the&nbsp;security&nbsp;of the ones we love is of prime importance to us. Because staying&nbsp;home&nbsp;24x7 isn&rsquo;t feasible, technology has made it possible to keep a check on the safety of our family, property and valuables.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Here is a list of the most commonly available&nbsp;security&nbsp;options in the market:</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        <strong>&lsquo;</strong>CCTV&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;Closed Circuit Television&rsquo;. It is the use of mounted cameras to transmit video signals to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. The data can be viewed in real time on your television or smartphone. It can also be saved to a hard disk for later viewing and archiving. CCTVs come in Indoor (Dome) as well as Outdoor (bullet) variants and with Day/ Night options. They also come in various sizes and colours so that they can be camouflaged easily. CCTVs are a great bet if you want to monitor what is going on in your absence or if you have a doubt that someone might be lurking around your property or valuables. CCTV footage is admissible as evidence in court.</p>

        As their name suggests, motion detectors are movement sensitive detectors that can be used to detect any kind of physical movement in a specified area. As soon as they detect movement, they usually trigger an alarm and send an SMS to your number.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Biometric locks</strong>: They might be expensive, but you can be sure that no one, other than the people whose fingerprints or retinas are scanned and recorded, can access a space that has a biometric lock. They are electronic and cannot be picked, and at times of power outage they remain in the locked position, so you need to keep a backup key with you. A great option is you have higher&nbsp;security requirements like a room containing valuables or important documents.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Burglar and fire alarms</strong>: Burglar and fire Alarms are remotely controlled and can be activated or deactivated, through a phone call or SMS. The advanced kits can get extremely expensive, but you can also opt for traditional, inexpensive wireless burglar alarm on your doors and windows. Burglar and fire Alarms usually activate a loud siren when&nbsp;security&nbsp;is breached, whilst simultaneously sending panic SMS&rsquo;s to you, your neighbours, police, or anyone else whose number you specify. A great option if you are going on leave or on work trips for extended periods of time.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Doorstop alarm:&nbsp;</strong>An extremely basic and simple system that prevents your door from opening and emits a loud alarm when anyone tries to enter your house. Doorstop alarms are great if you are worried about leaving your children or elderly parents alone at&nbsp;home.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Anti-theft padlock:&nbsp;</strong>As the name suggests, anti-theft padlocks are usually used on gates or main doors. They raise an alarm if someone tries to tamper with them.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Video Door Phones:&nbsp;</strong>Video Door Phones or Video Intercoms are found in many fancy buildings nowadays. The system consists of a viewing monitor inside the door and a camera outside that records a short video clip/live recording of anyone standing outside your door.&nbsp;&nbsp;The advanced models use WIFI and allow you to speak to your visitor, even when you are not at&nbsp;home. These are great for basichome&nbsp;security&nbsp;especially when you have women, children or elderly people staying alone at&nbsp;home. Video Intercom footage is also admissible as evidence in court.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Though we all are haunted by the thought of leaving our valuables or the vulnerable members of our family behind when we step out of our&nbsp;homes, the use of technologically advanced&nbsp;security&nbsp;devices can be of great help, to warn off imposters and alert you about&nbsp;security&nbsp;breaches in real time.</p>
