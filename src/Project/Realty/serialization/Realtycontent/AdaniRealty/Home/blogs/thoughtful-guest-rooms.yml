        There are more things you can do to the guest room in your house other than just keeping it neater than the rest of the house. With a little bit of thoughtful insight in to the requirements of most guests, you can create a space so comfortable that your guests will be sure to exclaim that they had a more comfortable stay in your guest room than if they would have rented a room at a hotel!</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        Avoid a last minute scramble by keeping full-time guest supplies on hand, such as toiletries, towels, and bedding. Store them in designated spots when they're not in use, rather than mingled with your everyday items. When the doorbell rings, you&rsquo;ll be relaxed and ready for your guests, not hunting for the extra pillows.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Have a night lamp installed</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Don&rsquo;t forget that your guests are not familiar with the layout of your home, so in the absence of a night light, they will either have to fumble around in the dark or have to risk waking everyone else in the room up by turning on all the main lights.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Provide a duvet as well as a lighter cotton sheet</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        It&rsquo;s awkward for any guest to keep disturbing the host multiple times with various requests. Ensure that you provide your guests the option of a light covering sheet as well as a thicker duvet, so that they can sleep comfortably whether they are finding it warm or cold.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Keep a bottle of water and some basic snacks in the room</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        That way, even if your guests are craving a midnight snack, or in case they wake up early, hungry, they will have something to kill their hunger without having to feel awkward about raiding your kitchen.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Have thick curtains/drapes installed</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Give your guests the option to sleep in late undisturbed by keeping the sun and heat out of the room in the daytime.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Have empty cupboard space available for their belongings</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        This will also work well to ensure that your guests don&rsquo;t clutter your room with their stuff.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Offer Your Wi-Fi password without them asking for it</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Handwrite the password on a nice piece of writing paper, on a card on the dresser or bedside table, or print one out and give it to your houseguests when they are settling in to the room.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Decorate the room with fresh flowers</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        An easy and affordable way to freshen up the bedroom is to decorate it with beautiful, fresh blooms and flowers. The inclusion of a bouquet next to the bed, or an arrangement placed on a dresser, shows that you have thoughtfully taken the time to make the room cheerful and bright for them. You can colour coordinate your flowers with the linen or colour scheme of the room, or provide contrast with a bright pop of colour in an otherwise neutral scheme.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Make sure the electrical sockets are visible and accessible</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Unless you want guests clambering underneath the bed to try and find a place to plug in their cellphones, it&rsquo;s important to keep the socket in reach &hellip; or at least let them know where it is at the time they are putting there luggage into the room.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Install a full-length mirror</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        A lot of time, people stay over when they are in town for business meetings, weddings or vacations. All these events require people to look and feel their best, and most people pack fastidiously in anticipation of these kind of days. Keeping this in mind, it is a thoughtful gesture to have a full-length mirror installed in the room so that your guests can get ready in comfort.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Ensure the room is thoughtfully lit</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Have a separate reading light, bathroom mirror/makeup light, and a night lamp in addition to the regular lighting of the room.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Throw in a smattering of both Basic Necessities as well as Simple Luxuries</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The following items will go a long way in making your guests stay a relaxed and comfortable one:</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        -Toothbrush and Toothpaste</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        -Hand wash</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        -Bottled Water</p>
        <p class="mb-2">

        <p class="mb-2">

        <p class="mb-2">
        -Fresh towels</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        -A fresh roll of toilet paper</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        -Flip flops (if you don&rsquo;t want them roaming around your house with their outside shoes on)</p>
