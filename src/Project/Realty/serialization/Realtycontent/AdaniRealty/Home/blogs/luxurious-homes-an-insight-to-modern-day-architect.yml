        From thatched roofed huts to buildings. From comfortable houses to luxurious homes, modern day architecture has come a long way since its inception. Where homes were earlier used as a shelter, today, they serve more as personality reflectors of the owners.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The concept of homes has evolved too! Where homes were earlier used as a shelter, today, they serve more as personality reflectors of the owners. People are constantly opting for homes that are more spacious, vaastu compliant and customised as per their need of space. The concept of <a href="https://web-dev.uat.adanirealty.com/township/shantigram-ahmedabad">luxury apartments</a> has become a fad today.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Our homes are predominantly seen as the extensions of our personality. How we choose to set up our place, the colours and paintings used to define the walls, the modern home decor items that we set up in our homes, speak volumes about us. The generation today has become smart in terms of choosing their way of living. They are ready to go the extra mile to give their homes an extremely personal touch. Home has definitely become more than just a place to live in, it has become a feeling.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        People have begun to use their homes to express themselves. You can immediately identify that a person is a travel connoisseur if he has a collection of souvenirs from around the world. A person who has a collection of vintage items can be seen as someone who appreciates and values vintage artifacts.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The younger generation is smarter and finicky about what they want. They know exactly what they are looking for and anything less is just not acceptable. Although the definition of luxury varies from individual to individual, the core remains the same - comfort and style.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        People are moving towards better lifestyles by opting for complexes that offer more than the basic niceties. Moving into luxurious home is considered imperative for lifestyle upgrading. Unlike 10 years earlier, when amenities like jogging tracks, spas, recreation centres and gymnasiums were considered as add-ons, they have become important pre-requisites for the luxury home seekers. The question today is what more? What more are home developers offering other than these basic amenities?</p>

        The increasing demand for exquisite bath fittings, luxurious spaces and customised wallpapers are just proof of the way the concept of luxurious homes is shaping.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
