        <p>India, the land of rich and vibrant festivals, is a melting pot of various cultures and diverse traditions. A reason for people to celebrate and socialize, festivals bring to life incredible feelings of enthusiasm and exuberance. Irrespective of caste, creed or religion, festivals are a way to strengthen bonds, bringing people closer together.</p>
        <p>While India remains in the mood of festivities and celebrations throughout the year, the uniqueness and colourful aura of such festivals light up the country. Festivals such as Diwali, Navratri, Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga Puja, and Christmas, among others, are some of the major festivals celebrated by Indians with a lot of enthusiasm. While festivals are a way for people to come together, these celebrations also conjure up the drive to revamp one's home to make it look fresh and clean.</p>
        <p><strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Major Indian Festivities and the Drive to Revamping Your Home:</strong></p>
        <p><span><strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">-<span> </span>Diwali:</strong></span></p>
        <p><span><strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue"></strong>Diwali, the festival of lights, is just around the corner. Celebrated to honour the return of Lord Rama after his victory over evil, the festival is signified with Lakshmi, the goddess of happiness and good fortune, entering the house that is clean, pure and bright. Based on the Hindu religion, Diwali also marks the end of a year as per the Vikram Samvat calendar and the day after Diwali brings in the new year, full of hope and new zeal.</span></p>
        <p><span>Given the traditions, Diwali also brings a time when people do up their homes. From walls to ceilings, every piece of furniture, equipment, chandeliers and lamps etc. are thoroughly cleaned. People also decorate their houses with lights, change their home decor with different fabrics, and bring the right mix of colours to revamp their houses.</span></p>
        <p><span>From stunning lamps to clean tableware to new covers for sofas and cushions, colourful and vibrant rangolis to drawing Laxmi's feet and swastikas with kum kum (an auspicious tradition), Diwali truly adds colour to every home.</span></p>
        <p><span></span><strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">- New Year:</strong></p>
        <p><span><strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue"></strong>Kartak Sud 1, the day that marks the beginning of a new year (as per the Hindu Calendar), is gloriously celebrated by people. While Diwali, the day gone by is celebrated by Hindus with Chopda Pujan (Pooja of books of accounts for a new financial year) followed by lighting crackers to end the year magnificently, the new year is welcomed by greeting near and dear ones with good wishes and blessings.</span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;	It's that time of the year when friends and family come together to celebrate the spirit of life and remember all the good things they have, while children await the gifts they receive.</span></p>
        <p><span>With festivals being a part of every culture, we at <a href="https://web-dev.uat.adanirealty.com/township/shantigram-ahmedabad">Adani Group</a>&nbsp;believe in keeping our spirit high around the time of such festivals and don't miss the opportunity to send good wishes to our esteemed customers.
