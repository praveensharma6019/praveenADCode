        <b>Ahmedabad – A UNESCO World Heritage City</b> </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Ahmedabad is one of the most culturally diverse cities in India, offering a plethora of experiences to its residents as well as locals. It is known the world over for its Navratri and Uttarayan celebrations.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        As per archaeological evidence, the area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, known as Ashaval or Yashoval. It was a well-developed region known for trading and manufacturing. Around this period, Karnadev Solanki, a Chaulukya dynasty ruler, established a city in the area and named it Karnavati. The city of Karnavati and the region of Gujarat saw several rulers and dynasties from Solanki and Vaghela to Delhi Sultanate and Muzaffarid. In the 1400s, the place came under Ahmed Shah's rule, who laid the foundation of a new capital on the banks of the Sabarmati River and renamed it Ahmedabad.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Ahmedabad was designated the first UNESCO World Heritage City of India in 2017 for its architectural and historical masterpieces in the Old City or the walled city. This area comprises streets, pols, mosques and temples dating back centuries. Some of the notable structures in the Old City are Bhadra Tower, Bhadrakali Temple, Ahmed Shah's Mosque, Sidi Saiyad's Mosque, Teen Darwaja, Tombs of Ahmed Shah's Queens, Jami Masjid, and Rani Sipri's Mosque. Other prominent landmarks include Sabarmati Ashram, Sabarmati Riverfront, Kankaria Lake, Adalaj Stepwell, Auto World Vintage Car Museum, and Drive-in Cinema.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <b>Ahmedabad – A Plethora of Experiences</b> </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        In addition to being a city rich in cultural and historical experiences, Ahmedabad is a vibrant metropolis that has witnessed rapid growth in the last two decades. Real estate, infrastructure, finance and education are the areas where this development is the most visible. Today modern structures dot the city's landscape and afford it an ultra-modern look. Malls like Alpha One and Ahmedabad Central bring a host of Indian and international brands closer to Amdavadis. The presence of IT parks has invited globally reputed names across industries to set up shop in the city. The work for Ahmedabad Metro and the Ahmedabad-Rajkot 6 lane highway is underway. These aspects make Ahmedabad an up-and-coming town to live in. </p>
        <p class="mb-2">As per the Ease of Living Index 2020, Ahmedabad ranked number three among Indian cities with more than a million people <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/thelife/news/these-are-indias-top-10-most-livable-cities-according-to-the-governments-ease-of-living-index-2020/slidelist/81331506.cms">(Business Insider)</a>. Ahmedabad is also amongst the first 20 cities to be developed under the Smart Cities Mission of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs <a href="https://ahmedabadcity.gov.in/portal/smartcitymission.jsp#:~:text=Ahmedabad%20was%20selected%20among%20the,on%2015th%20of%20Dec%202015">(Ahmedabadcity.gov.in)</a>.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">When it comes to education, one of the most prestigious management institutes of the county, IIM Ahmedabad, was established in the city in 1961. It led to the metamorphosis of Ahmedabad into an education hub with various schools and colleges offering multiple courses in diverse streams. Institutes like MICA, NID, St. Xavier's, IIT, and Gujarat University have attracted talent from all parts of the country.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">Places like Sabarmati Ashram, Hutheesing Jain Temple, Vaishno Devi Temple, Nirma University, ISKCON Temple, Ahmedabad One Mall, Law Garden, Gujarat Science City, Calico Museum of Textiles, Nehru Bridge, Amdavad ni Gufa, Riverfront Flower Park, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Vastrapur Lake, Vikram A Sarabhai Community Science Centre, and Gujarat Vidyapith, genuinely reflect the spirit of the city, which is a perfect combination of a strong foundation and progressive mind.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">The growth story of Ahmedabad is an inspiring one, with progress evident in all areas of life – from highways, bridges, and museums to schools, offices and people's outlook towards life.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 txt-d-blue"><strong>Amdavad Progressive Chhe – An Adani Realty Campaign</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">Gujarat, in general, and the city of Ahmedabad in particular, has always had a progressive outlook towards life and education. The increase in the number of education institutes and job opportunities has taken that outlook up by a few notches. A growing number of people are relocating to <span class="txt-d-blue">#ProgressiveAhmedabad</span> from other cities and states either for better work opportunities or education. People from within Ahmedabad are also shifting base to be closer to their place of work or study. The city dons a bustling look throughout the day due to an increasing number of malls, restaurants, tech parks, and other recreation areas.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">An area that is fast developing and touted to become the next big thing in Ahmedabad is the city's northwest side. It has various development projects along and close to the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway. Within a 10-km radius lay many attractions thronged by tourists and locals alike. </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <b>About the Campaign</b> </p>

        <p class="mb-2">The Radio talk points of the campaign compare how the city was a few decades ago and how it is now. Through interactive sessions on the Radio, the city itself speaks. The conversations bring out the progressive changes in the lives of the people residing in Ahmedabad, reflected through their experiences and relationships.</p>
        <p class="mb-2"><strong><span class="txt-d-blue">Amdavad Progressive Chhe</span></strong> highlights some true stories from the city, which bring to fore the progressive side of the city, but in a warm and heartfelt manner. The story of a father supporting and even encouraging his daughter's move to a different corner of the city to be close to her office! The story of a young, independent woman choosing to move to Ahmedabad for her big career move because Ahmedabad is progressive, well-developed and safe for women!</p>
