      Hint: Description
      Value: "While sustainability is always an initiative that demands unhinged struggle, Adani Realty puts its best foot forward to meet the current needs without compromising the future.    Our obligation towards the three pillars of sustainability– Environmental, Social and Governance (the ESG model) has always been steadfast and at par with times, significantly since 2020, when the pandemic altered the dynamics of climate change and real estate. Despite the robust approach, we keep updating our policies, including limiting the use of technology that leads to heightened Greenhouse Gases, more dependency on renewable sources for energy, allegiance towards meeting zero-carbon footprints in the near future and creating environment-friendly workspaces for employees, to name a few. We believe in providing real estate solutions for tomorrow. "
