      Value: "A Power of Attorney (PoA) or letter of attorney is a written authorisation to represent or act on another’s behalf in private, business, healthcare and legal matters, sometimes against the wishes of the other. The authorised person is known as the agent or attorney-in-fact, who is usually a legally competent relative or close friend over 18 years old. The person authorising the other to act is the principal, grantor, or donor (of the power). A PoA is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an immovable property. Generally, one chooses a POA as a provision if he or she becomes incapacitated."
