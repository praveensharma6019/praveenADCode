        <p>Samsara denotes &lsquo;wandering through and flowing on&rsquo;, a notion that each apartment in the community evokes. Whether it&rsquo;s birthday bashes, silver/golden wedding anniversaries or simply a retreat where you can lie back and slurp your Pi&ntilde;a coladas merrily, Samsara is the destination for the perfect celebrations. Samsara offers 3 &amp; 4 BHK independent floors in Gurugram. Each building has best-in-class elevators and a designated parking area.</p>
        <p>The ready to move in apartments exudes architectural brilliance as the floors were designed by the acclaimed Woods Bagot with precise meticulousness. Each room has its individual aura that forms a deeper connection with your inner self. Your home will be amidst the most elegant social infrastructure and lush green open areas where you can soak in the rays of dawn or bask in the shades of the moon. While the interiors are nothing less than brilliant artwork infused with technology, helping you drink the elixir of luxury, the outside is filled with a plethora of amenities.</p>
        <p>The Belvedere Club will be one of the star attractions of the property. Spread over 1,00,000 sq. ft., The Belvedere Club is currently being developed by Adani Realty. It will have many hangout spaces where each place will give you something new to cherish. The multi-cuisine restaurant shall be filled with delicacies that will inspire you to try something new each time, and the lounge bar and terrace will be great for a gala time with your friends and family. The banquet hall is spacious, the gardens and pool parties are unforgettable, and the luxury rooms are an ingenious fuse of design and grandeur. Additionally, there will be a platinum lounge, entertainment zones, cards and games room, and more. All of this (and more) will make Samsara one of the most happening and sought-after residential projects in Gurgaon.</p>
        <p>Sports lovers will find their paradise in the club as the place will have a swimming pool, indoor badminton court, squash courts, netted cricket pitch, table tennis area and half-basketball practice court. Even indoor sports aficionados will enjoy their time at the pool table with vigour. If you wish to keep your workout steady, you&rsquo;ll be able to sweat it out at the gym or in the aerobics and yoga section on the terrace. If you feel tired and let go of the stress from your body, the spa will be where you can ease yourself.</p>
        <p>Samsara stands as an example of a multi-hyphenated independent floor community that has everything to suit the comfort of a cosmopolitan lifestyle. But most importantly, beyond the modernity that it reflects, it emphasises on making you feel safe, positive, and bestowed with the warmth of family.</p>
