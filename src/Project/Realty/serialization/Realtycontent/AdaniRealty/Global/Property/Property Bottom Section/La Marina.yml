        <p>There are multitudes of amenities that you will enjoy as a resident of La Marina. It’s a paradise for all age groups. Whether it’s sports, recreation, social gatherings or a simple walk in the vicinity, La Marina offers everything you expect from an ultra-modern housing society. While the fully-air conditioned apartments are super-deluxe and strike a fine balance between grandiose and simplicity, the penthouses are the apple of the eyes. The 5 BHK living spaces are stellar examples of architecture par excellence and give you a slice of the regale lifestyle that most can only dream about.</p>
        <p>Sports lovers will love to break a sweat at the multiple centres of indoor and outdoor games like the accessible tennis and badminton court, a box cricket and a box football zone or dabble with different games with your friends, family and fellow residents in the indoor sports area.</p>
        <p>If you want to step away from sports for a while, you also have a fitness centre like the gymnasium. Apart from this, you can release stress and anxiety at the yoga deck by the lake. It will be the most comforting and gratifying experience to help you form a mind, body, and soul connection.</p>
        <p>The facilities for sports and fitness equally extend to kids who have access to most of the above places and a dedicated skating rink to roll on their wheels like a champ. At the same time, there is a toddler’s swimming pool where they can take baby steps towards becoming an ace swimmer. Won’t that be a sight to behold? Speaking of kids, the creche is where they will love to spend time, learn new things and make many friends.</p>
        <p>The other eye-warming amenities that you will be getting include an amphitheatre, a community hall, party lawn, landscaped garden, senior citizens’ sit-out and lakeside promenade that will lead you to one of the most razzamatazz attractions of the society– the Light and Sound Fountain which is one of India’s biggest, and most importantly, just a walk away from your home. Enliven those warm, cosy evenings like never before.</p>
        <p>La Marina is built with the idea of creating a homely society that sets an example for the idyllic lifestyle that every denizen yearns for. Together with other housing societies that form the contemporary Shantigram township, form one of the most trailblazing residential projects of Ahmedabad. Buy 4 BHK flats or 5 BHK penthouses in Shantigram, Ahmedabad and invite your friends, family and colleagues to have a gala time.</p>
