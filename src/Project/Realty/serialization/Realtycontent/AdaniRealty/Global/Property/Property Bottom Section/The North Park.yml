If you have hobbies and interests, this is the one-stop centre that provides you with the necessary space to pursue them with a neverending zeal.

Within the building premises, there is a family lounge, a pooja room, a gymnasium, a play area for kids, palatial terraces and deck, a multi-purpose basement area and much more.</p>
        <p>Equally fascinating locations within Adani Shantigram that are neighbouring The North Park are- The Narmada Canal, The Belvedere Golf and Country Club and lush green stretches bringing calmness to your eyes and peace to your mind.</p>
        <p>As the legendary Le Corbusier once famously said, &ldquo;To be modern is not a fashion, it is a state&rdquo;, your journey into a contemporary lifestyle awaits at the thresholds of The North Park.</p>
