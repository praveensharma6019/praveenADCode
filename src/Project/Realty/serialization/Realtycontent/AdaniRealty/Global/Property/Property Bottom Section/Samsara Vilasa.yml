        <p>As you enter the neighbourhood of Samsara Vilasa, you’ll be startled by its outlook that features an unconventional blend of everything you expect from an upmarket housing society (and more)– innovative buildings on both sides of the wide-boulevards, lush green landscapes, sporting arenas/grounds and plenty of amenities for all age groups that define the place’s comely disposition.</p>
        <p>The interiors of every apartment, be it 3 BHK or 4 BHK, will be the reason for the twinkle in your eyes as they were meticulously planned and designed by interior designers who are the best in the business. Each room is vastly spacious and has been raised using top-quality materials that alleviate the residents' experience of avant-garde living standards. The homes have VRV air conditioning, modular kitchens and a few units with the provision for private terraces and basements. Top-notch elevators in every building will help you manoeuvre faster, and the dedicated automobile parking helps you station your cars and bikes with utmost safety. Speaking of safety, the entire area is under high-end CCTV surveillance with video door phones.</p>
        <p>Samsara Vilasa is filled with a plethora of amenities that enable you to lead an active and socially benevolent lifestyle. The place has ample open spaces sheathed with burgeoning green coatings that create a healthy and breathable atmosphere. It’s further extolled with many trees and orchards, which add a natural charm and calm to Samsara Vilasa’s presence. This is visible in Central Park, a textbook definition for green. A casual stroll in the park will help you find a connection with nature. You can also go there for your morning/evening walks, jogs and exercises. It also has a space for kids to play.</p>
        <p>An abundance of other facilities makes the place among the most premium residential projects in Gurugram. The beautifully constructed entrance plaza welcomes you with an enticing vibe. The serene pathway leads to the dry deck fountain, which is pleasant to watch. You can also find yourself in the trellis with seating arrangements and the exclusive clubhouse, which is enormous and forms an integral part of the housing society’s social circuit.</p>
        <p>The residential space is a boon for sports and fitness lovers as there are many spots where one can easily sweat it out with finesse. One such space is the outdoor gym area with various equipments, making workouts fun and engaging. Besides, there’s a half-basketball and badminton court for people to enhance their game.</p>
        <p>At Adani Realty, our goal is to symbolise the essence of family, togetherness, and harmony – the values that form the Adani Group’s basic tenets. Samsara Vilasa is a place that carries these values giving you not only a roof over your head but a space where you can feel safe and relish the joys of life without compromises.</p>
