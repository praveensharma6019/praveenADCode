        	<p class="mb-3 d-block">The Adani Foundation has been striving to create sustainable opportunities for the marginalized communities for over two decades now. Over the years, the focus has extended from geographies where the Adani Group operates its business, to regions that are in a dire need for timely and relevant interventions. With an aim to contribute to the holistic development of these communities, the Adani Foundation is contributing to building the human resource capital and hence, to building the nation.</p>
        	<p class="mb-3 d-none">At Adani Transmission Limited (ATL), in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we engage with local groups and associations to implement targeted programmes that emphasise good health, quality education, sustainable livelihoods and community infrastructure. Being a transmission and distribution company we cover long-length geography having sparse settlements except for the Mumbai distribution business. Accordingly, ATL has decided to spend more on CSR programs for targeted communities in Mumbai. The company wishes to focus on skill development, quality of life improvement, issues related to safety and 5S. Pursuant to this, ATL is using Adani Foundation’s existing strength in these areas and leveraging the experience.</p>
        	<p class="mb-3 d-none">Adani Transmission has established a framework for identification of the communities, evaluating the needs and implementation of CSR programs. The philosophy is to collect the baseline, then decide 3-5 year goal and then implement the identified programs. Midterm reviews are done for course correction if required. In this manner, the company is bringing meaningful change amongst lives of local communities where it operates. </p>
