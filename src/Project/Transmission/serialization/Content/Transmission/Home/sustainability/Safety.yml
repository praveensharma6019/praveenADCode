        <p class="mb-3 d-block">The Health and Safety of our people is paramount to us. Our goal is to ensure &ldquo;No Fatality, No Injuries and No Excuses&rdquo; to all staffers and contractors.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-block">We consider high safety risks in our projects and electrical safety risks in our O&amp;M. We ensure strict adherence to industry-best practices across our operations and strive to improve our occupational health and safety performance to create a safe and secure workplace. Therefore, we have implemented Safety Management Systems across our projects and O&amp;M to identify and manage hazards, risks and emergencies.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3  d-none">We have also strengthened our safety culture through engagement of all workforce in our safety committees at all sites to meet our set objective of &ldquo;No Fatality, No Injuries and No Excuses&rdquo;.  Our total workforce is represented in formal joint management systems. As part of the annual safety calendar, safety committees meet every month and develop actions plans. Our employees actively participate in the management of occupational health and safety and are provided regular training on health, safety, security, emergency preparedness and crisis management.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3  d-none">We have a robust system to capture safety observations &ndash; consisting of unsafe acts and unsafe conditions through various mechanisms such as site safety inspection by top management, site safety representatives, internal audits, external audits and mock drill by the group safety department.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-none ">We have set a system to monitor various lead and lag safety indicators to measure our safety performance at all sites. We focus on leading indicators, which include near misses, safety observation, safety training, mock drill, safety promotional campaign, tool box talk, safety committee meeting. It is ensured that labels, indicators, posters, tags and signage related to safety aspects are displayed for awareness.
