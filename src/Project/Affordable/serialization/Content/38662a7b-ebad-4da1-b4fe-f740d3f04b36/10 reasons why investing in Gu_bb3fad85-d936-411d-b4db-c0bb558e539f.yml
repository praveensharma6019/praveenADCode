The city boasts of clean, wide roads and dozens of hospitals, schools, colleges, parks, and shopping areas. Moreover, being a relatively new city, the constructions are all still pretty new, so the whole city has a very spectacular, new-age feel to it.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Abundant Job Opportunities:</strong> Nearly 250 Fortune 500 companies have set up their base in Gurgaon. Global giants such as Coca-Cola, BMW, Pepsi etc. have their office spaces there.

        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Organized sectors:</strong> Gurgaon is a completely planned city. It is divided into multiple sectors, of which some are purely residential, some only commercial and some mixed.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Education Hub:</strong> A good education is never far away if one chooses to settle in Gurgaon.

        <strong class="txt-d-blue">Good Health Systems in place:</strong> You can be sure of medical assistance being close at hand no matter what the issue. Gurgaon is home to branches of some of the most technologically advanced medical institutions in the country. Some of these are Medanta Medicity, Paras Hospital, Artemis, Fortis, Columbia Asia and Max Hospital.</p>
