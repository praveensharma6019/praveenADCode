        <ol class="numberedList orderList2">
            <li>
            <p class="txt-md">Uninterrupted supply</p>
            <p>PNG offers the convenience of ensuring continuous and adequate supply of PNG at all times, without any problem of storing gas in cylinders.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p class="txt-md">Unmatched convenience</p>
            <p dir="ltr">We had to carrying out tedious task of LPG cylinder booking, refill, time and again. Then wait for the deliveryman to deliver the cylinder. Switching over to PNG renders this entire exercise unnecessary. PNG also eliminates the tedious routine of checking LPG refill cylinder for any suspected leakage, or it being underweight, at the time of delivery. Precious space, occupied by LPG cylinders is also saved.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p class="txt-md">Safety</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Natural gas is lighter than air. Therefore, in case of a leakage, it just rises and disperses into thin air given adequate ventilation.</p>
            <p>PNG can be switched off through Gas Tape (inside the kitchen) and isolation valve (outside kitchen premises), which fully cuts off the gas supply.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p class="txt-md">Billing</p>
            <p>We charged for the quantity of PNG used with no possibility of any pilferage as the billing is done through meter as per usage. A unique feature is that we have to pay only after consumption of gas. The bill is delivered at our doorstep. In addition, there is wide-range of payment options available which is convenient and hassle-free.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p class="txt-md">Customer support</p>
            <p>Round-the-clock customer support is assured through 24 hrs number 079-27623264 backed by control rooms, which are manned by trained and expert team of engineers and technicians. Thus complaints, if any, are promptly redressed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p class="txt-md">No daily Liaisoning</p>
            <p>We didn&rsquo;t have to do task of Liaisoning with oil companies and co-ordinating with them for ensuring the daily supply of fuel, because PNG is supplied directly through pipes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p class="txt-md">No spillage and pilferage</p>
            <p>In case of fuels like HSD and LDO, there were considerable chances of spillage and pilferage. In case of PNG these losses are invariably down away as PNG is supplied through pipes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p class="txt-md">Lower maintenance cost</p>
            <p>With PNG, soot or ash accumulation and greasy spillages are absent from our appliance. Maintenance costs are, thus, driven down.</p>

            <li>I personally found cost of PNG 10-15% cheaper than LPG which leads to more profit for organization.</li>
            <li>24*7 availability of Gas is a major benefit.</li>
