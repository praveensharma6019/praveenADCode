        <p>CNG stands for Compressed Natural Gas. It is a gaseous fuel and is a mixture of hydrocarbons, mainly methane, in the range of 89% to 90%.Due to its low density, it is compressed to a pressure of 200-250 Kg/cm&sup2; (g) to enhance the vehicle on-board storage capacity.

        <p> Yes, it is safe. The properties of CNG make it a safe fuel. It is lighter than air, so in case of a leak it just rises up and disperses into the atmosphere. Besides, a high auto-ignition temperature of 540 degrees centigrade as against petrol&rsquo;s 360 degrees centigrade, makes it a safe fuel. Also, in case of a leak, if CNG&rsquo;s concentration in the air is less than 5% or more than 15%, the gas will not burn even in the presence of a spark.

        <p>CNG cylinders are manufactured from a special steel alloy and are seamless in construction. Their compact size allows them to easily fit even in a small car. An empty CNG cylinder with a 50 liter-water-carrying capacity weighs 48 kg (approximately), with a length of 835 mm and a diameter of 316 mm. The 50 liter capacity cylinder is the one most regularly used; cylinders with 45 liter, 55 liter, 60 liter and 65 liter capacity are used as well.

CNG cylinders are safe as they are manufactured as per specific requirements and tested before use, in accordance with international specifications and standards, and are duly approved by the Chief Controller of Explosives. Moreover, they are provided with a pressure relief device (PRD) that consists of a fusible plug and a burst disc that ruptures in case of inadvertent high pressure and temperature.

        <p>Owing to CNG's distinct features, it does not contaminate or dilute crankcase oil, giving a new lease of life to the engine. The absence of any lead content in CNG helps avoid lead fouling of plugs, thereby enhancing plug life. One of the important benefits of CNG is that upon entering the engine in the form of a gas (and not as a spray or mist like other fuels), it doesn't disturb the presence of lubricating oil in the engine, and reduces chances of wear and tear.
