        <div id="collapseseven" class="card-body collapse" data-parent="#accordion3">
        <div class="p-4">
        RBI has introduced the Electronic Clearing Service which allows electronic credit of the dividend amount to your bank account for the amount due to you.
        The salient features are:
        Instant credit - This Facility provides instant credit of dividend amount to your bank account electronically at no extra cost. ECS also eliminates the delay in postal transit and fraudulent encashment of warrants.
        Optional Scheme - This scheme is optional Coverage - ECS is presently available in major cities/centres like Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune. RBI has been extending this facility to various centres from time to time. The scheme is at present available only for payments upto a maximum amount of Rs 500,000.
        Procedure for credit - Under this facility the amount of dividend payable to you would be directly credited to your bank account. Your bank branch will credit your account and indicate the credit entry as 'ECS' transaction in your passbook/statement of account.
        In case ECS facility is not made available to you by the Company/their Bankers at a particular centre or the amount payable to you exceeds Rs 500,000, the dividend amount due to you would be remitted by means of a dividend warrant which would be posted to your address with the particulars of the bank/branch and account number furnished by you duly incorporated on it.

        <div class="p-4">
        <p>To dematerialize your holding, you should first have an account with a Depository Participant (DP) of your choice. You may then hand-over to your DP, the certificates along with the Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF). Only the securities registered in your name can be submitted for dematerialization. Your DP will then send the DRF and the certificates to Link Intime and an electronic request will also be sent through the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) or Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) network reconfirming the same. Link Intime will verify the documents and if found in order, the dematerialization request will be confirmed to NSDL/CDSL who will in turn inform your DP.In the books of the Company, your folio with Link Intime will be debited and the account of NSDL/CDSL will be credited in respect of such dematerialized securities. NSDL/CDSL in their electronic records will credit the account of your DP. Your DP will then credit your account with the number of securities that have been dematerialized and the securities will thereafter be held in electronic form. This process would take approximately 15-20 days.</p>

        <p>With a view to enabling the shareholders to appoint nominees for their shareholding(s), the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999 has made provision under which a shareholder can now nominate a person in whom the share or debenture or deposit would vest with, in the event of former's death. Pursuant to this provision, the Department of Company Affairs has by Notification No GSR 23(F) dated 12th January, 1999 prescribed Form 2B for making nomination in respect of shares, pursuant to Rules 4CCC and 5D of the Companies (Central Government) General Rules and Forms, 1956.
        Hence you can make a nomination by filling in and sending Form 2B singly if you are a sole holder or jointly if you are joint holders to SSIPL. After verifying your signatures your nomination would be registered and an intimation of the same would be sent to you, which you are requested to preserve to avoid any future.
