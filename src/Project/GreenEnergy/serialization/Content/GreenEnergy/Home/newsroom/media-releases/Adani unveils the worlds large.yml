The plant is set up at Kamuthi, Ramanathapuram in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, with an investment of around Rs 4,550 crore.</p>
         <br />
        <p>The plant is part of the state government’s ambitious yet highly achievable target of generating 3,000 MW as per its new solar energy policy unveiled in 2012. The Company sourced equipments and machinery from various parts of the World to set up the entire 648 MW within a record time of 8 months. A total of around 8500 personnel worked hard day &amp; night for averaging out about 11 MW of installation in a day to set up the plant in the stipulated time.</p>
         <br />
        <p>Speaking on the achievement,<strong> Mr. Gautam Adani</strong> , Chairman, Adani Group said, “This is a momentous occasion for the state of Tamil Nadu as well as the entire Country.  We are extremely happy to dedicate this plant to the nation; a plant of this magnitude reinstates the Country’s ambitions of becoming one of the leading green energy producers in the World. I would like to express our deepest gratitude to the Hon’ble Chief Minister and the government of Tamil Nadu for their valuable support and guidance in achieving this gigantic feat”.</p>
         <br />
        <p>The  massive plant comprises of 3,80, 000 foundations, 25,00,000 solar modules, 27,000 Mt of structure, 576 nos of inverters, 154 nos of transformers and 6000 km length of cables. The entire plant was completed in all shape and ready to generate the 648 MW of clean and green energy. The entire 648 MW is now connected with Kamuthi 400 KV substation of Tantransco making it the<strong> WORLD’S LARGEST SOLAR POWER PLANT AT A SINGLE LOCATION.</strong></p>
         <br />
        <p>The Adani Group is in a phase of revolutionizing the renewable energy ecosystem of India by building solar power plants, solar parks and manufacturing facilities with seamless integration. Setting up of the 648 megawatts (MW) Solar Power Plant in Tamil Nadu is a step in this direction.
