Adani Wilmar Limited's (AWL) Export Division commenced its operations in 2004 and today it has extended its footprints across the word; United states of America, Canada, Middle Eastern countries, South East Asian nations, Africa etc. are some of its key markets. In a short span of time, AWL has been awarded the status of Trading House, by Government of India.</p>
