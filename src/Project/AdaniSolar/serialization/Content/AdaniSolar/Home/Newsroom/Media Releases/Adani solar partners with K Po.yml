                                <strong>Coimbatore, May 25, 2019:</strong> Adani Group’s solar manufacturing arm - Adani Solar, today
                                announced the launch of its retail distribution business in Tamil Nadu (TN) with K Powers
                                (a Kondaas Group Company), an exclusive channel partner for the region. In a span of
                                three months, Adani Solar has expanded the retail distribution of its solar panels in seven
                                regions, helping over 500 cities across the country meet their renewable energy
                                requirement. It is an important milestone for Adani as it continues to contribute to the
                                Indian renewable energy sector. The partnership with K Powers is a stride towards
                                facilitating the switch to sustainable solar power, across consumers, SMEs, MSMEs and
                                institutions in TN at the lowest capex costs.

                            <p>
                                Solar power is the fastest growing source of electricity generation as the government is
                                increasingly introducing clean energy targets. Among the Indian solar panel
                                manufacturers, Adani Solar maintains its market leadership position. It is the only
                                manufacturer with IEC 2016 certification in all stock keeping units. TN is an emerging
                                solar power producing state with many big firms switching over to solar energy. Vision
                                Tamil Nadu 2023, a strategic plan for infrastructure development in Tamil Nadu, includes a
                                solar energy target of 5000MW. Adani Solar will contribute to achieve the state’s goals in

                            <p>
                                Commenting on the announcement, <strong>Ramesh Nair, Chief Executive Officer, Adani Solar</strong>
                                said, “The Indian renewable energy sector has witnessed tremendous success in installed
                                renewable power generation capacity in the last few years. A densely populated state,
                                Tamil Nadu has been encouraging installation of rooftop solar panels to make households
                                electricity self-sufficient. Through our association with K Powers, we will be able to offer
                                our customers certified solar panels at competitive rates for all applications.”
                            </p> <br />
        
                            <p>
                                <strong>Mr. Nair</strong> further added, “Adani Solar is looking towards making India energy efficient and
                                sustainable by effectively using renewable resources. We have established our retail
                                network of solar panels in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and
                                Kerala; thereby growing our footprint across the country. Through our exclusive channel
                                partners in these regions, we have retailed more than 20MW solar panels till date. We aim
                                to achieve a greater reach and visibility of our product in the country by bringing down
                                power consumption costs for our consumers and reducing load on the grids. On the retail
                                front, Adani Solar will target an aggressive 50 percent market share.”
                            </p> <br />
        
                            <p>
