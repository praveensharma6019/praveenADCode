        <p class="mb-3">Adani Agri Logistics Limited (AALL) has signed an exclusive service agreement with the Food Corporation of India. The project has been implemented at a total cost of nearly Rs. 700 crores.</p>
        				<p class="mb-3">The key feature of the project is that the entire handling of the food grains, right from receiving at Base Depots, cleaning and drying as well as storage and transportation to field depots is carried out in bulk form, thus minimizing the losses. These units are notified procurement centers of FCI, where farmers deliver their produce directly in bulk form.</p>
        				<p class="mb-3">Fully automated operation ensures quick service, transparent & accurate transactions at all stages and timely payment to farmers. </p>
