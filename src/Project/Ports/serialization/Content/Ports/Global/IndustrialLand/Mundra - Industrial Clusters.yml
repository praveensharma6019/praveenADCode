        			<p class="mb-3">Mundra has land available in parcel sizes of 1 – over 500 acres. Mundra Manufacturing Zone provides equal opportunities for all the industrial sectors. However, cluster based industrial development strategy is based on the assumption that such strategy provides greater economic benefit to the units.</p>
        			<p class="mb-3">Cluster based development model is successfully implemented at Mundra SEZ, with the development of cluster for the textiles. We have been awarded the Mega Food Park contract by Government of India. With the vision of Make in India, we aim to focus on the development of five more industrial clusters – Chemicals and Petrochemicals, FMCG, Logistics, Heavy Engineering, and Plastics. We aim to build industrial clusters by partnering to provide all support infrastructures for each of the above.</p>
