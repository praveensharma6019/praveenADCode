The state has the longest coastline among all states in India-1600 Kms. Mundra provides an ideal location for product evacuation due to the shortest logistics connectivity to the North-Western hinterland. Mundra port is an ideal location from all major destinations i.e. Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, MP, Haryana, Punjab and HP for export of cargo. The port based multi-product manufacturing zone is well connected to all major global locations through sea – Middle East, Europe, US, Africa, Indian Subcontinent, Far East/South East Asia.</p>
