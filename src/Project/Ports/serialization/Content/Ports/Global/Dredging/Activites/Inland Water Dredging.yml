        		<p class="mb-3">APSEZL has ventured into creating and maintaining India's National Waterways. We have recently taken up three distinct projects in the National Waterway 1(NW1). The projects involve deployment of 6 smaller CSD's over a 300 km stretch of NW1. Our fleet is supported by extensive offshore, onshore support equipment along with the requisite ancillary equipment and pipelines.
