        <p class="mb-3">APSEZL&rsquo;s core strength has been in capital dredging. We own and operate 12 CSD&rsquo;s of varying sizes and capacities which enables us in taking up a variety of work. We have 4 booster stations which can be utilized along with the dredgers for long distance pumping. Our fleet is supported by extensive offshore, onshore support equipment and pipelines.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Using our capital dredging equipment, we have successfully reclaimed land from the sea to create the largest coal import terminal in the world. Our in-depth knowledge of the abilities of our equipment enables us to take up a variety of challenging assignments.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Some of the offbeat projects that we have successfully implemented in the recent past are:</p>
        <ul class="ul-circle">
            <li>Creation of intake and outfall channels for power plants; including breaking of rock in the channel via chiseling</li>
            <li>Breaking old quay walls with the help of chiseling and blasting</li>
            <li>Extensive port development and expansion projects under challenging sea conditions</li>
            <li>Approach channel deepening and widening projects.</li>
        </ul>
