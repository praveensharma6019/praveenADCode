                                        <p class="txt-xs">The EMRIP project (Ennore Manali Road Improvement Project) is a vital link for connecting the Ennore port to the majority of CFS’s located along the stretch of roads covered under this project. This would facilitate seamless movement of containers to and from CFS’s to Ennore port and vice-versa.</p>
           <p class="txt-xs">Northern Port Access Road, an ambitious project to improve connectivity to the Ennore port, is all set to take off with the state highways department commencing land acquisition process.</p>
           <p class="txt-xs">The 25 km-long four-lane road will provide the much needed direct connectivity between the port and Thatchur on National Highway-5. Orders have been issued to commence the land acquisition for the project aimed at improving connectivity to the Ennore port and to boost industrial growth in North Chennai.</p>
           <p class="txt-xs">The proposed new road will connect the Northern gate of Ennore Port and Thatchur on NH-5 with an additional spur road for connecting to the Thiruvottiyur-Ponneri- Pancheti (TPP) Road.</p>
           <p class="txt-xs">The total length of this road connecting Ennore Port to Thatchur would be about 21.15 km and length of the TPP link road will be 4.35 km. The proposed road would provide easy access to NH 5, which would connect Kolkata via Andhra Pradesh and Odhisha from Ennore port. </p>
