        <p>Since 2000, the Adani Group has been realising its vision of building a healthier nation, through its flagship Edible Oils brand Fortune. The thoughts prompted us to venture into the field of sports and kick-start a movement to make popular in Gujarat.</p>
        <p>This led to our association with the &lsquo;Gujarat Fortune Giants&rsquo;, which meant giving Gujarat its very own Kabaddi team in the widely successful Pro Kabaddi League. We believe that our efforts wouldl ensure that Kabaddi thrives in the hearts of millions and inspires many more to play the game.</p>
        <p>Owned by Adani Wilmar Ltd., Gujarat Fortune Giants was one of the four teams that entered the fray last year but already commands a huge fan following. 2017 this season, and with an assured fan following, this promises to strengthen Gujarat&rsquo;s unacknowledged association with Kabaddi.</p>
