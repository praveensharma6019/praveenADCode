        <h3>Adani Ahmedabad Marathon - #Run4OurSoldiers</h3>
        <p>From Berlin to Boston, marathons world over became part of every global city’s social fabric. The Adani Ahmedabad Marathon took its inaugural stride in November 2017 and successfully completed its third lap on November 24, 2019. It has earned runners’ affection for offering one of most picturesque routes in the world. Our race categories include <strong>Full Marathon, Half Marathon, 10 Km, and 5 Km Run.</strong></p>
        
        <p>These races, that attracted nearly 20,000 participants in its first two editions, saw over 12000 participants in the third edition. Of these, 7500 were timed runners and more than 4500 participated as fun runners. The latest edition’s total prize money was 30 Lacs – with 10 lacs for participants from defence background and 20 lacs for local participants.</p>
        
        <p>A distinct feature of the Adani Ahmedabad Marathon has been its cause “#Run4OurSoldiers”, as it presents a unique opportunity for participants to pay a tribute to our soldiers. More than 1500 personnel from the Defence establishment - Air Force, Army, and the Navy have participated in our races so far. A major portion of the proceeds is contributed towards the welfare of the Indian Armed Forces. </p>
        
        <p>As a token of respect & gratitude, Adani Group made a donation of 50 lacs towards the Armed Forces Welfare Fund in its third edition. A huge Army & Air Force weapon display was created for participants and spectators to enjoy. Hon. Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupani was present as Chief Guest to encourage the runners. </p>
