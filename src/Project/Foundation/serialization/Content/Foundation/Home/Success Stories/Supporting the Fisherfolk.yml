      Hint: Description
      Value: |
        <p>For fishermen, life revolves around the sea, fishes and the fishing nets. Their net is the most important equipment for them to earn livelihood. Most of the fishermen borrow money to buy or rent the fishing nets. Since, the nets are very critical for their livelihood, they are usually charged high amounts by the money lenders and the renters. Also, as it is a recurring expense on buying, renting and maintaining the nets, they get caught in a vicious circle of debt. Moreover, due to lack of financial literacy,  the fisher-folks usually do not save for such buying or mending of nets even though it is an integral part of their livelihood. Their income is just enough to make their ends meet, so they are unable to afford the costs of replacing the nets. Though, there is a real need for them to develop a habit of saving,  it has to be preceded by having some extra income which will allow them to save.
