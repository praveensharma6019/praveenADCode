      Value: We realize that as the Adani Group grows larger, our responsibility to give back becomes even larger and we are determined to collectively work to fulfil this. What the Adani Foundation has achieved and continues to achieve is astonishing. Astonishing because of the sacrifices the members of the foundation make day in and day out to make a difference in the individual lives of people. I am grateful for the work they do and have no doubt that in the days ahead their “Doing Better” will continue to shape our “Thinking Big”.
