        <p><strong><em>Satvik Bhuvad with his parents after recovering at GAIMS</em></strong></p>
        <p>Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic the hospital has treated around 7,000 cases of COVID-19 in the in-patient department (IPD) and approximately 15000 patients have attended the COVID-19 outpatient department (OPD). Additionally, around 2 lakh patients have visited the hospital outpatient department for other ailments and 30,000 patients have been treated in various other in-patient departments.</p>
        <p>All healthcare workers and resources across the country have been diverted towards saving lives. Even though they have been vaccinated, many of their family members have not. And so when my staff members or I return home, we are still worried. We do not want to carry the virus to our families. I want to emphasize on the fact that while the medical fraternity is doing their best, there is no way to predict who will suffer from the worse version of coronavirus infection. So our best bet is to not allow it to touch us or our loved ones, and for that we must do everything in our power. Whether you have suffered from COVID-19 or not, have antibodies or not, whether you have taken none or one or two doses of the vaccine, wear a mask. Wear double masks. Don&rsquo;t be a carrier and educate those around you.&nbsp;</p>
