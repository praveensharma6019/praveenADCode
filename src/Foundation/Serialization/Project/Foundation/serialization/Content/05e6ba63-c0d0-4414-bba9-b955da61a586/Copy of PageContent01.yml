        <p>With the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Kutch, the beds were gradually increased from 45 to 500. This necessitated the presence of more manpower in the hospital due to the requirement of isolation of suspected patients. For more than a year now, 24X7 availability of healthcare workers and faculty members has been ensured. And there is no stopping any time soon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The central oxygen supply system is already installed at GKGH. Due to various treatment modality of oxygen therapy in COVID-19 critical patient and also non- COVID critical patient, as well as the steep surge in the number of patients requiring it, 3 new oxygen generation plants have been installed over the past few months. An additional oxygen generation plant with the capacity of 200 oxygen cylinders per day and liquid medical oxygen tank with storage capacity of 20kL are under installation and will be functional shortly.</p>
