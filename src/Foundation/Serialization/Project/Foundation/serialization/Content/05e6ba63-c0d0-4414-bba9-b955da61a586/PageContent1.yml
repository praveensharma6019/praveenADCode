        <p>Despite the most stringent measures in place, our patients as well as staff members have suffered. Many of our doctors have contracted and beaten the virus in this period of one year, resuming duty soon after recovery. Currently, many doctors, resident doctors and nursing staff have one or more relatives infected with the coronavirus. Now more than ever, they are trying their best to help patients who come not only from far corners of Kutch but also from other districts like Morbi &ndash; from hundreds of kilometers away.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amidst our everyday struggles, it is easy to forget how far we have come, yet humbling to look back and realize that we have helped many critical patients. Patients of all ages, those with co-morbidities and those with severe respiratory illnesses. Be it our youngest COVID survivor Satvik Bhuvad who was 4-months-old when he was brought to us for treatment, be it our eldest patient &ndash; 95 years old Khimji Hirani who is a diabetic, or Divya Soni who tested COVID positive close to her delivery date &ndash; our doctors not only treated her for COVID but also successfully delivered her healthy baby girl.</p>
