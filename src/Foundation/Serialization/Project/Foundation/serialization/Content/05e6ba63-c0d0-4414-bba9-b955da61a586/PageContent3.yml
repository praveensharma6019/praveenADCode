        <p>Empowering ourselves with knowledge and focusing on things that can be improved or controlled can help us navigate the ever-evolving situation in the upcoming months. Here are some ways to achieve the same:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&bull;<span> </span>Changing our Perspective: Instead of wishing that things go back to normal, it is important to understand and accept that normal has changed. Social distancing while in public, working from home, wearing masks and hand hygiene will be the new normal for the near future.</p>
        <p>&bull;<span> </span>Getting Vaccinated: Nobody is safe until everyone is safe. Get vaccinated at a government or private vaccination centre near you. You can even get inoculated in a state different from your home.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&bull;<span> </span>Staying Informed: Follow the correct and verified channels of information like the MoHFW website or the official social media handles of your local governing bodies. Take all precautionary measures at all times.<br />
        <br />
