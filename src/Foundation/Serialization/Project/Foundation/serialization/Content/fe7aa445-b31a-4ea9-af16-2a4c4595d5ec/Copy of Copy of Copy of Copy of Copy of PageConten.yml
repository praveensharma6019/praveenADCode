        <p>Because of the availability of small skill sets and an open market, a large pool of youth have brought innovative ideas to life and have become job-givers rather than job-seekers. Some such examples are Tilak Mehta (16) of Papers &amp; Parcels, Ritesh Agarwal (27) of OYO Rooms, Sreelakshmi Suresh (23) of TinyLOGO, Divya Gandotra Tandon (18) of Scoop Beats Pvt. Ltd. and Suumit Shah of Dukan App.</p>
        <p>With the World Bank Supported program, India is offering business development and mentoring underprivileged entrepreneurs. Since the program began in 2011, more than 1,200 youth entrepreneurs have emerged, generating more than 11,700 new jobs. However, this data is limited to the programs supported by the World Bank. There will be thousands of more such youth who have largely emerged as job-givers. Innovations from the youth are supporting &lsquo;Growth with Goodness&rsquo; and contributing to nation-building in all aspects. It is our job to enable more of them to spread their wings and soar, limitless.&nbsp;</p>
