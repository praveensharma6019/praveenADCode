        <p>I see largely two different aspects on the increased ratio of youth unemployment in India:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1.<span> </span>Increased population (it is an economic advantage also in some aspects)<br />
        2.<span> </span>Lack of technical training for increased automation in industries</p>
        <p>Due to the increase in technological and telecommunication advancements, industries today need a skilled workforce that can constantly upgrade itself on improved technologies. They have moved from traditional operations to smart operations. This is true for both manufacturing units as well as the service industry. The world has moved from DOS to Windows 10, from Basic &amp; Fortran to Python 3 &amp; Google Go, from Symbian to Android &amp; iOS, from VCR to Netflix and from social gatherings to social media. But of all these advancements, which one did the education system cover in the last 20 years?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our formal education system does not include any of the advanced technologies with degree courses. So, often, the degrees that youth pursue to become employable are not sought by industries &ndash; creating a&nbsp; gap in the demand and supply for employment opportunities. To address this problem, I think we are moving in the right direction by offering short-term skill development training in India, where the youth can pick and play with the course to judge his/her own capabilities. These small courses prove to be huge steps in career progression as industries look for specific skill sets rather than only formal degrees. What needs to be done further is designing and developing multiple and affordable online course offerings so that the youth can be motivated to learn on his/her own time with required skill sets.&nbsp;</p>
