        Adani Foundation was felicitated by the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr. Vijay Rupani in recognition of the water conservation work carried out in Kutch region. <br /><br />
        Kutch region had been facing severe water shortage for a couple of years owing to drought. Villagers, farmers and their cattle were receiving the brunt of it. Adani Foundation decided to put special efforts in mitigating the situation, complementing the initiatives put in place by the district administration. <br /><br />
        In the long run, the ground water table was getting depleted fast. There was also a need to do large-scale and sustainable water conservation efforts.<br /><br />
        Adani Foundation constructed 18 check dams in Kutch district in last two years. This effort led to an increased storage capacity of 505 million litres. In addition, 44 ponds had been deepened that created additional storage capacity.<br /><br />
        “In the year 2018-19 during scarcity of water and lack of fodder in Kutch district, your organization Adani Foundation came forward to help the people of Kutch. Adani Foundation took care of cattle and provided fodder in 27 villages of Kutch. To increase ground water level pond deepening, well and bore well recharge was done. More than 7000 trees were planted at different locations of the district. For this the District Administration Department is proud of your organization. In critical time your organization was working in eliminating the issues related to environment along with other social causes. We are thankful and hope for your support in the development of State and Nation,” acknowledges the citation conferred by the CM. <br /><br />
        Adani Foundation has been working almost since its inception in across six talukas of Kutch region covering 81 villages with multi-faceted approaches. <br /><br />
