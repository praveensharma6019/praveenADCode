        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Speaking on the occasion, <b>Ms. Sushama Oza, Director, Adani Foundation</b>, said, “As a Sangini, the community volunteers will be given knowledge and skills through trainings to act as peer counsellors and advisors.

        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><b>An AEML Spokesperson</b> said, “Women empowerment is one of the strongest rays of hope in countless ways right from altering attitude towards women in the society to reinforce them economically, physically and socially. Providing benefits of various government schemes, health and nutrition schemes will not only uplift but also empower them to have shining examples of women achievers in India.”</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Swachhagraha -- Swachhata ka Satyagraha is a Behavioural Change Education Programme. Swachhagraha draws inspiration from Satyagraha led by Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle movement, which catalysed action through tremendous patience and perseverance, instilling in the Indian mind, dignity and self-respect. It aims at engaging people and bringing about a change, similar in scale to India's freedom movement, where people get involved to take action for ‘Creating a Culture of Cleanliness’. Recognising the need to address safety especially with children, the component of Safety was added to this project. 
        <br />
        With school children as the flagbearers and teachers as the mentors, Swachhagraha will be active in Government, Government-aided and Private Schools in Mumbai, across different mediums like Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Urdu, Hindi, English and Gujarati.
