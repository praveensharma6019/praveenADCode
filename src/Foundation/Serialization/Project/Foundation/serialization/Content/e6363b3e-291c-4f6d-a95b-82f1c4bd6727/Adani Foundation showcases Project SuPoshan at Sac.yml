        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Gandhinagar, 18 September</b>: The Government of Gujarat organised an event to celebrate September month as the Poshan Maah (Nutrition month) on September 18 at Sachivalaya, Gandhinagar. Adani Wilmar’s SuPoshan Project implemented by Adani Foundation also presented its work at the event. It showcased its efforts specifically in the aspirational district of Narmada, Gujarat through the film. On the occasion, Chief Minister, Shri Vijaybhai Rupani also launched the SuPoshan Recipe Book. </p>
        
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">SuPoshan Sanginis from Narmada shared about their passion, commitment and hard work leading to children and women breaking the vicious cycle of malnutrition and anaemia. “Active involvement of community members is key to alleviating malnutrition and anaemia. In SuPoshan Sanginis, we have a resource from the community who carry the mantle of creating a healthy India,” said Ms. Sushama Oza, Director, Strategy and Sustainability.  </p>
        
        
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the Narmada district, Adani Wilmar’s SuPoshan Project implemented by Adani Foundation, is uplifting the lives of 5,90,297 people in 569 villages by providing them proper guidance and support to help them live a healthy life. Sanginis plays a pivotal role in operating the project. A total of 196 SuPoshan Sanginis became a part of the project in the district who became facilitator and counsellor to the families and at community level. The project also covers 952 Anganwadis, where it provides structured support. In the Narmade district, since the launch of the project in December 2018, the project has been able to bring more than 3000 children from the status of being malnourished to healthy.</p>

        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">"Fortune from the house of Adani Wilmar, is privileged to partner the government of Gujarat in addressing malnutrition in children, adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating mothers. We are a brand with a heart and a purpose. This is our small endeavour to giveback to the community in line with our Chairman's vision of contributing towards a healthy, growing nation. Our products provide wholesome nutrition as our edible oils are fortified with vitamins, hence addressing malnutrition is a logical extension," said Mr. Ajay Motwani - Head, Marketing Adani Wilmar Ltd.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Adani Foundation signed an MoU with the Government of Gujarat in June 2018 to roll out SuPoshan in the district of Narmada. SuPoshan is a community based management of Malnutrition and Anaemia. It aims to reduce occurrence of malnutrition among children, reduce malnutrition and anaemia in adolescent girls and pregnant/lactating mothers as well as reproductive age group women and support the government's efforts in reducing Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR). This is done by creating a pool of resources at the community level especially Sanginis who bridge the gap between all the stakeholders, are a facilitator and a community knowledge resource.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Poshan Maah is celebrated as a part of POSHAN Abhiyaan. POSHAN Abhiyaan (National Nutrition Mission) is India’s flagship programme, launched in March 2018 to improve nutritional status of children up to 6 years, adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers to achieve specific targets for reduction in low birth weight babies, stunting growth, under nutrition and prevalence of anaemia over next three years. ‘National Council on India’s Nutrition Challenges’ on 24th July 2018 decided to celebrate the month of September as Rashtriya Poshan Maah. During this month activities related to nutrition awareness will be carried out by all the states/UTs up to the grass root level.</p>
