        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ahmedabad, October 18, 2019</strong>: Adani Vidya Mandir, Ahmedabad (AVMA) hosted a three-day awareness workshop on Accreditation Standard for Quality School Governance from October 16-18. The workshop was organised by Quality Council of India. 18 Heads of Schools from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan attended the workshop. This is first-of-its-kind workshop in Gujarat. National Accreditation Board for Education &amp; Training (NABET) is one of the statutory board of Quality Council of India (an autonomous body under DPIIT, Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry, Govt. of India) mandated for Accreditation of Education/ Training institutions and personal certification.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The host school, Adani Vidya Mandir, Ahmedabad (AVMA), is a model school which has recently received National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET) Accreditation and hence has been chosen for hosting the workshop. NABET under Quality Council of India (QCI) had certified AVMA as the &lsquo;NABET Accredited School&rsquo; thus making it the first cost-free school in India to achieve this feat. This had made AVMA a symbol of academic and human excellence following the highest standards set by the nation. AVMA is a 100% process driven school where processes and their implementation are first audited thereafter validated by a third party, QCI: the highest National Accreditation Body.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The workshop aims at facilitating schools to understand the requirements of Accreditation Standard for Quality School Governance, guiding schools for efficient utilisation of resources for effectiveness of the system, capacity building of schools for effective Curriculum Planning, delivery of Curriculum &amp; Assessment Techniques for learning, handholding schools for benchmarking their practices with reference to research-based national &amp; international best practices and, enabling schools for creating a healthy, safe and protective learning environment and attaining organizational excellence.
