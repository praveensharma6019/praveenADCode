        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Ahmedabad, Gujarat, February 22, 2019:</strong> There is no single universal solution to bringing transformational change in the society, was the message from Dr. Priti Adani, Chairperson, Adani Foundation. She was delivering the inaugural address at the National CSR Conclave and Awards of Gujarat CSR Authority at AMA, Ahmedabad.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">Dr. Priti Adani emphasised on the need to work with people keeping in mind their context and needs. “My early efforts and struggle in Kutch left the indelible impression that change context for fishermen, cattle breeders, farmers and widows are unique and different programmes are needed to do justice to achieve CSR goals. Foundations need to excel in passion, commitment and courage - passion for the cause, steadfastness in commitment and courage to experiment,” she said.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">Ms. D Thara , IAS, CEO, GCSRA, Dr. J.N Singh, Chief Secretary, Gujarat, Mr. A.M Tiwari, IAS, Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Gujarat, and other distinguished guests Mr. HR Dave, Deputy Managing Director, (NABARD), Mr. Arvind Aggarwal, Additional Chief Secretary ( Finance) , and Mr. Mr. MK Das, IAS, Principal Secretary , IMD, were the other dignitaries present at the occasion.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">Dr. Priti Adani has been spearheading the CSR activities of Adani Group as the Chairperson of Adani Foundation. Established in 1996, Adani Foundation today has widespread operations in 18 states that include 2250 villages and towns across the country with a team of professionals who work with an approach that embodies innovation, people participation and collaboration.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">Touching the lives of more than 3.2 million people and passionately working towards creating social capital with focus on four core areas – Education, Community Health, Sustainable Livelihood Development and Infrastructure Development, Adani Foundation acts towards inclusive growth and sustainable development of the rural and urban communities, in turn contributing towards nation-building.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">Dr. Priti Adani said that institutions like Gujarat CSR Authority are important to ensure exploration and co-learning for the many organisations existing in the eco-system of development. “GCSRA has donned multiple hats with equal ease: a guide for mid-size businesses to&nbsp; direct energy towards national development, initiator in worthy experiments, and the referee to adjudge which is outstanding CSR as distinct from the good,” she said.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">An educationist and a qualified doctor with Bachelors in Dental Surgery (BDS), Dr. Priti Adani has been treading a path hitherto less travelled in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) space. Focusing on the mantra of Growth with Goodness, Dr. Adani is as much a businesswoman as she is a responsible citizen helping create sustainable solutions to complex problems.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">Dr. Priti Adani has been spearheading Adani Foundation, her brainchild, passionately for two decades now. Dr. Adani has been ensuring that the Adani Group positively touches and helps transform the lives of as many people as possible.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
