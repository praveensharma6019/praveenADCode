        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Not far from Zarpara is the Bhukhi river, on which the Adani Foundation had constructed two dams in 2011-12 and 2013-14 respectively. The rainwater from these catchment areas have recharged the groundwater which percolates to bore wells, making cultivation of fruits and vegetables possible again for farmers like Gulab Chauhan who hails from Mangra. He mentions that until two years ago, only 30-40% farms were operational due to water scarcity and high levels of TDS &ndash; the number has now increased to 80-90%, ensuring sustainable livelihoods for more than 500 farmers from villages like Bhorara, Mota Kapaya, Tappar, Depa etc. </span></p>
