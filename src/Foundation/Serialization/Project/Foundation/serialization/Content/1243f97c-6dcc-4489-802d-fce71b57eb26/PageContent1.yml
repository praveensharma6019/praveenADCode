        <p>While building check dams in water stressed areas is indispensable, the Adani Foundation has been implementing practices of recycling and re-utilization of water. This was not possible without entering the backyards and farms of the people. The CSR teams have held community meetings, soliciting partnership to introduce rooftop rainwater harvesting, pond deepening and bore-well recharge methods. These are affordable, easily implementable and highly replicable techniques. The Foundation is also promoting user efficiency through drip irrigation, providing support for expansion of horticulture and encouraging reduced water intensity in agriculture by influencing cropping pattern.</p>
        <p>Let me illustrate this further and for that, let us go all the way to India&rsquo;s western-most tip to Mundra in Kutch. The Adani Foundation&rsquo;s water conservation activities first took shape in this water-scarce region under project Swajal &ndash; addressing the steady depletion of ground water, high levels of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and frequent drought-like conditions.&nbsp;</p>
