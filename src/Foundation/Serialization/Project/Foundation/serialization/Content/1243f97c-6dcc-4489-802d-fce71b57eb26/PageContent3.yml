        <p><em><strong>Kanji Gadhvi, Navinal</strong></em></p>
        <p>Kanji Gadhvi, a farmer from Navinal, has just started to grow dragon fruit on a part of his 3-acre land which is not far from the sea. It is impossible to use the salty water for irrigation but the possibility of bringing piped water from 2 kms away has ensured that his fields, which are mostly covered by date palms, are well-nurtured.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        Adani Foundation&rsquo;s water conservation initiatives have impacted more than 2.18 lakh people like Virbai, Gulab and Kanji. According to data from Water and Sanitation Management Organization (WASMO), the TDS in the ground water has dropped by 16.9% on an average, in 12 villages. Over the last 5 years, ground water table has risen by 4.2 ft. Storage capacities of check dams and ponds have increased by 106.44 MCFT. For farmers, this has translated into a 20% increase in net irrigated area, up to 40% increase in agricultural yield and 20% rise in revenue. Water availability has also ensured the safety and overall well-being of women and children in the area. On an average there has been up to 25% decrease in the families&rsquo; expenses on healthcare.</p>
        <p>In recognition of our mission to go from water scarce status to water adequate condition, the Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) Ltd, Mundra, Kutch, was awarded in 2019-20 the National Water Award &ndash; Best CSR in India for water conservation. Mobilizing community members, not just for their participation, but to make them stakeholders is imperative. Water literacy bolstered by sound practices in communities has cultivated good health, good crop as well as immense value. Water security and agricultural diversity translate into nutritional security and economic prosperity. And beyond those worthy goals, sustainable development and desirable ecological balance is becoming visible.</p>
