        <p>This year&rsquo;s theme for World Water Day is &lsquo;Valuing Water&rsquo; &ndash; reflecting upon its true value to people and working towards its protection. At Adani Foundation, the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) arm of Adani Group, we have the privilege and responsibility to work with and for communities in the areas of water conservation and management. To this end, our continuous endeavour is to engage communities, converge state action at the local level, and focus on what brings positive change in the life of people by enhanced water availability.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        Today, we work not only with multiple government departments but other institutions like the Gram Panchayat, farmers&rsquo; groups and most importantly the end users i.e. the community members. This collaborative action leads to highly localized solutions, comprehensive programmes as well as smooth execution. With the responsibilities shared, the benefits too are better valued.&nbsp;</p>
