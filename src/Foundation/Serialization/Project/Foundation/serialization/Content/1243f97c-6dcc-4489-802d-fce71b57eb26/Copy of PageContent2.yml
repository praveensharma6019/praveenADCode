        <p><strong><em>Virbai Seda, Zarpara</em></strong></p>
        <p>Virbai Seda, a 47-year-old resident of Zarpara villages says that earlier, every single day her family would have to either buy filtered water bottles or travel to get 20 litres water from the Panchayat. With a rainwater harvesting structure installed prior to the monsoon season last year, a 10,000 litre tank is filled, enough to fulfil the drinking and cooking water requirements for her family of five members until the next monsoon. Virbai&rsquo;s home uses water from a recharged borewell for other domestic and irrigation purposes &ndash; they employ the drip irrigation method extensively. The family grow dates for commercial sale and alongside the NB21 grass for good quality and copious fodder for the cattle. An adjacent kitchen garden makes enough seasonal vegetables and fruits available for the household. The family benefits from the home biogas connection, the slurry from which is used as manure for the fields. This &lsquo;model farm&rsquo; is a result of collaboration between the Seda family and the Foundation team.&nbsp;</p>
