        <p>When Babiben Dataniya from Bhujpur village received support to own a handcart for selling vegetables, it seemed like someone kept her afloat as she swam against the current. Both her younger sisters are also differently-abled and the handcart is a tool that enables her to run the household. Today, she’s able to earn INR 8000 per month, providing not only for herself but also for her family. Similarly, when Juneja Salmaben Satarbhai of Wadala village suffered a paralysis attack, the lower half of her body became movement-less. Her desire to supplement the household income reached our team who then provided a small cabin next to her house. Today, Salmaben’s monthly earnings of INR 2,500 to 3,500 is very helpful in educating her children, which has boosted her self-confidence greatly. My team and I are privy to the ripple effects that a small wave of help can create. </p>
