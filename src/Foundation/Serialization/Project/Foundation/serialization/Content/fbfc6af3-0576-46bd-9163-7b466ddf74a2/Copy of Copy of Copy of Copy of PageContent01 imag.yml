        <p>Further, the Adani Skill Development Centre conducts a Digital Literacy Training Program for differently-abled students in alignment with the vision of Department of Social Justice and Empowerment. This program provides them non-domain employability skills which will add value to their domain skills. The trainees receive certification and increase their chances of employability. </p>
        <p>Till date Adani Foundation has supported 455 divyang (differently-abled) persons for getting benefits of Divyang pension and other schemes of Government of Gujarat (GOG). It has also supported more than 35 divyang persons to initiate their livelihood be running a flour mill, tailoring venture, ration shop or E-Rickshaw. The satisfaction that I have seen on the faces of my co-workers and on the faces of the community members is unmatched. Their demands are small but their gratitude is grand. It has become especially important to alleviate the additional challenges that the differently-abled persons have to face in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.</p>
