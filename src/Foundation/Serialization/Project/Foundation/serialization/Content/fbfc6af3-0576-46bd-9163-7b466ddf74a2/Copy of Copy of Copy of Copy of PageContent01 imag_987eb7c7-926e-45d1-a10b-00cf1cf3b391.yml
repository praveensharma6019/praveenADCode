      Value: "<p>Take for instance Narpatsinh Pravinsinh Jadeja of Hatdi village in Mundra taluka for whom the first step was to obtain certificate of disability as per the Government rules. Next, was to support him with a three-wheeled bicycle to ensure mobility. Finally, for a sustainable income source, he wanted help to start a flour mill. His request was taken up and Adani Foundation funded 90% of the expenses for the same. Today, Narpatsinh is self-sufficient and earns INR 2000 to 5000 per month. Typically, these are the three ways in which Adani Foundation team assists the differently-abled population in Kutch – through linkage with Government schemes, fulfilling requirements for mobility and finally, providing livelihood related support.</p>"
