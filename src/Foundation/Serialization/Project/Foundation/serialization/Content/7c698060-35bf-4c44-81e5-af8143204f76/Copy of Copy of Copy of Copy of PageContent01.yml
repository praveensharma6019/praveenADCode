        <p>The third model is &lsquo;Transform&rsquo; with a more ambitious goal of tackling a development challenge in an innovative and multi-faceted way. When the problem definition may be unclear, partners bring differing world views to the issue, negotiating the path to be followed to collectively find a feasible solution that is acceptable to all stakeholders. The &ldquo;Gyanodaya&rdquo; project being implemented in Godda (Jharkhand) is a perfect example. It has been successfully implemented by AF, District Administration, Eckovation and Panchayat Raj Institutions, covering more than 70,000 students (classes 6-12) in 284 government schools.</p>
        <p>With Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as the primary tools, the initiative uses Eckovation&rsquo;s mobile-based platform to provide contextualized video-based learning modules and regular, comprehensive evaluation of students&rsquo; progress. Every element, from students' daily attendance to performance are uploaded on the platform to ensure that the public education system becomes responsive, student-centric, and transparent. At the same time, teachers are accorded due accountability as well as assistance in teaching-learning methods through this multi-platform model. The impact is visible &ndash; Godda district, which was at the 22ndposition in 2018 in the Jharkhand state as per class 10th passing percentage, progressed to 14th position in 2021.</p>
