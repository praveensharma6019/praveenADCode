        <p>Ahead of National Youth Day 2022, the Adani Skill Development Centre (ASDC) launched a 90-day skill-based training programme for 51 youth (age group of 18-35 years) from Mundra&rsquo;s fisherfolk community. The programme has been designed to train the youth to enhance their skills in masonry, bar-bending and electricity, opening doors to alternative livelihood opportunities.</p>
        <p>With the highest youth population in the world, India is poised to grow along with its young citizens. Policy makers, governments and civil society organizations have the responsibility of creating decent work opportunities for the skilled, educated, and updated youth of the country.</p>
