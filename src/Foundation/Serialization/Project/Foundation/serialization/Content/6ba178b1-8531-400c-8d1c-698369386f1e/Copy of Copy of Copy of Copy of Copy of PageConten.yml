        <p>The Adani Vidya Mandir, Ahmedabad (AVMA) has been strengthening its resolve to support students in building their future. Take for instance the journey of Siddharth Bhuva, who joined AVMA in the academic year 2011-12. He grew into an inquisitive learner. The Olympiads, computer classes and school&rsquo;s club activities fuelled his passion for science. In class 11, recognizing his aspiration, he was selected and sponsored for Joint Engineering Exam (JEE) coaching. It was no wonder then, that he secured All India Rank (AIR) 171! He stood 10th in EWS in JEE Advanced 2021, securing admission in Computer Science stream in his dream college &ndash; IIT Mumbai! Siddharth has started his first semester online.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Reversing Livelihood Related Migration</strong><br />
        The modern youth is aspirational, they aspire for better life and livelihood opportunities. The lack thereof leads them to migrate to urban cities, accepting even menial jobs. Reviving and prioritizing agriculture ensures sustainability and prosperity for the agricultural community. It also makes a strong case for the youth to take up the family occupation farming, an otherwise unattractive prospect. For instance, in Dahanu (Maharashtra), an integrated wadi (farming) programme has doubled the income of 1,000 tribal families via structured blend of horticulture, floriculture &amp; vegetable growing. The project converted more than 500-acre barren land to cultivated land. Another 100 families have been provided with need-based entrepreneurship support. This has reversed migration of the youth to urban cities, enhancing not only the agricultural productivity and monetary returns but also standard of life. Additionally, it is brining stability to their children&rsquo;s education. In fact, when factories and service industries were closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, opportunities in agriculture, animal husbandry and home-based enterprises helped the rural population to sustain.</p>
