        <p>In Kutch, the Foundation is promoting high quality date cultivation through tissue culture in consultation with Krishi Vigyan Kendra and has set up the Kutch Kalpataru Producer Company (KKPC) to empower date palm cultivators in their farm-to-market journey. It has also facilitated water conservation work, increasing water storage capacity to 78,17,468 cubic metres and benefitting more than 19,000 farmers. Other similar initiatives in the areas of livestock development, fodder cultivation, dairy farming, vermicomposting, mushroom cultivation, horticulture, drip irrigation etc. are directly benefitting more than 12000 farmers and almost 6000 women&rsquo;s Self-Help Group members &ndash; and the numbers are only increasing day by day!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As hardcore corporates develop their philanthropic strategies, they can pay much needed attention to CSR spending in agriculture, which is far less than other sectors. They can address bottlenecks in the storage, supply chain and logistics infrastructure. After all, agriculture cannot be looked at in isolation when the broader goals are to reduce poverty, ensure food security and halt (and possibly even reverse) the migration to urban areas. The next step forward is making provisions at policy level for Governments to partner with CSR firms, assisting agripreneurs to prosper and boosting growth which is both economically and environmentally sustainable in the long run.<br />
