        <p>Traditionally, agriculture has been a way of life for farmers in India. They are now trying to do things in a better way but the journey to innovate, to adopt new things has only just begun. The possible resolution is a shift &ndash; first in mindset and then in practice. In other words, rather than viewing agriculture as a source of livelihood, we need to build it as a business entity, so that farmers, especially the youth, become market savvy agripreneurs armed with improved cultivation techniques, who are not forced to migrate to urban areas to earn a decent living. Agripreneurs who are ready to cater to the evolving consumer habits/demands, enhanced environmental regulations, new requirements for product quality check and supply chain management.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A sharp focus on horticulture, integrated farming, and planned cropping pattern can help mitigate the issues associated with marginal land holding. In this context, policy-level interventions as well as capacity building are crucial &ndash; and for both, keeping in mind the feminization of agriculture, a focus on women is inevitable to achieve success. Organizations in the social development sector too, including CSR firms, are exploring their role in agricultural development &ndash; which is intrinsic to social and economic development of rural communities.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With an aim to support farmers that have marginal, small, and sometimes even declining land holding, Adani Foundation is working in 2,409 villages across 16 Indian states. It facilitates upgradation of farming skills through improved cropping practices and crop diversification, leading to reduction in both external inputs and cost of cultivation. For instance, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a low-cost, organic farming technique that requires less water, uses only organic manure and gives a higher and high-quality yield. The Foundation has facilitated 12,000 farmers to adopt the SRI technique in Tirora, Dhamra, Surguja, Raigarh and Raipur. It pays particular attention to bring women working in agriculture into the mainstream by facilitating direct and equal access to training of improved agricultural practices such as SRI.&nbsp;</p>
