        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The tangible impact of the project can be seen in the employment of women and the generation of a source of revenue. There has been a shift towards healthy and hygienic behaviour in the community, which can be substantiated by the increase in the use of toilets through the interactions and awareness generation of the women selling phenyl. Also, with the production of sanitary pads by the women's cooperative, about 80% of women have started using sanitary pads, reducing the incidences of diseases. It has promoted social, financial, and economic inclusion. The cooperative formation has also led to the social empowerment of the women by increasing their access to public services, negotiating power, and improving food security, health and nutrition.</span></p>
