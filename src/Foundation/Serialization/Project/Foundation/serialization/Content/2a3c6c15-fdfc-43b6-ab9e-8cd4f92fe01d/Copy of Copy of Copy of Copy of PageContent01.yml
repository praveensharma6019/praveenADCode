      Value: "<p>Another such role model of self-reliance is <strong>Mrs. Bandhan Porte</strong>. Her journey has been a remarkable one and has played a crucial role in the formation and institutionalisation of MUBSS. Alongside working to engage more and more women through this initiative, she also focused on her transformational journey. She completed her education and is currently pursuing an MSW so that she can contribute more towards her pledge to improve the lives of rural women and their social and economic empowerment.</p>"
