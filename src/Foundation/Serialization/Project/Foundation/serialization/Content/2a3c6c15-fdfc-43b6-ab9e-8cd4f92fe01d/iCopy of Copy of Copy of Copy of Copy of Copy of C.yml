        <p>Women&rsquo;s cooperatives have played a crucial role in empowering rural women, ensuring them easier market accessibility, services, resources, education, and more inclusive and sustainable business models, thus contributing to rural areas&rsquo; social and economic development.</p>
        <p><strong>Mrs. Amita Singh</strong>, from homemaker to cooperative chairperson, says the journey of self-reliance was not an easy one. Before she joined MUBSS, she was confined to only four walls of her household. She was dependent on her husband to fulfil all her needs and expenses, and at times, being a woman, she had to compromise on her wishes and dreams. She became self-reliant after joining MUBSS. More than 100 women have been economically empowered under her leadership. She is pro-actively leading the movement of women's empowerment and plans to engage more and more women in this initiative.<br />
