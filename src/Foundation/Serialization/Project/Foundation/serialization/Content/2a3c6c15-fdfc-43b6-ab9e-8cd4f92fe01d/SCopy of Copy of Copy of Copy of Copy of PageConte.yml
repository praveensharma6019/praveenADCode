      Value: "<p>Besides economic empowerment, these women are also working towards the social transformation of the community in the areas of health, sanitation, and education through organising various campaigns and awareness programmes. MUBSS, under the guidance of the Adani Foundation, is working in the area of education of rural children, with a special focus on the needy and poor, by leveraging their own resources and pooling in those of the community. They are running a residential education facility, Naunihal Shikshan Ashray, at Salhi village. They are also facilitating women's SHGs to get into social entrepreneurship for income generation by producing and selling social need-based products like sanitary pads, white phenyl, and handwash. Alongside the production, they are also sensitising the target community through their health awareness programmes and campaigns.</p>"
