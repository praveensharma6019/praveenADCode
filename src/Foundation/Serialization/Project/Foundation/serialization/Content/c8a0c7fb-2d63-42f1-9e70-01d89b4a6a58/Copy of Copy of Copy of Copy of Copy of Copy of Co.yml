        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Here, it is fitting to mention Fortune SuPoshan, a special project, which binds the Adani Foundation&rsquo;s three core areas of work &ndash; namely education, health and sustainable livelihood development &ndash; into one. It targets to alleviate malnutrition and anaemia among children in 0-5 years of age, adolescent girls, pregnant women, lactating mothers and women in the reproductive age.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>This has been made possible by training community women as SuPoshan Sanginis to go door to door and become a true partner in guarding the community&rsquo;s health. A SuPoshan Sangini plays a pivotal role in spreading awareness, referrals and promoting behavioural change among the target groups to achieve the project objectives. In FY 2021-22, 418 SuPoshan Sanginis reached out to more than 3.5 lakh women and adolescent girls, and more than 1 lakh+ children across 1000 villages.</span></p>
