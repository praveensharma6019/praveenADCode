        <p>Adani Foundation supports tribal women who are engaged in traditional methods of earning like collection of forest produce and lac production. Three Self Help Groups (SHGs) namely Gouri, Prerana, and Annapurna in Khamariya, Karwahi and Milupara villages respectively are fetching good returns from mushroom cultivation. A total of 30 women are getting livelihood support in this manner. Further, livestock training for farming communities contributes immensely to a rural household economy. Veterinary Camps at Khamariya, Dholnara, Milupara and Karwahi villages were organized where 1,683 cattle of 324 farmers were treated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At Dahej in Gujarat, CSR interventions are implemented in 7 core and 5 peripheral villages. Although Dahej site is known as an industrial hub and villages are urban in nature, but tribes like Rathod and Halpati are still subject to miserable living conditions. The Foundation supported the construction of 32 houses in Lakhigam, Luvara and Jageshwar villages.This Awas model is now adopted by other industries of the area. Construction of various other structures such as water tank, bus stand, pond development etc. was taken up based on the need and demand of the communities, benefitting a population of 25,000 persons.&nbsp;</p>
