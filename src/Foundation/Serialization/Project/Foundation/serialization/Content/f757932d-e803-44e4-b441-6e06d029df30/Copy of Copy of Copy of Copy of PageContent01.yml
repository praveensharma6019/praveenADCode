        <p>In terms of education, project Utthan has helped enhance the learning levels in more than 3,000 primary school students. Through a focus on foundational numeracy and literacy, and the support of designated Utthan Sahayaks (Foundation appointed supporting faculty members), the existing learning machinery in government schools is bolstered. In 2019-20, the Foundation started CSR interventions in the tribal village of Thava (Netrang Taluka). An athletic track was developed for students at Eklavya Sadhna Higher Secondary School, helping students to prove their talent in athletics at the state level. More than 1,000 students of 15 nearby villages are studying here. In 202-21 a solar panel was installed in this school as poor electric supply disrupted daily routine work. After their secondary or higher secondary education, tribal students tend to opt for police services or prepare for staff selection commission exams. To cater their needs, the Foundation constructed a library building with seating arrangements for 36 students. This library has optimum infrastructural facilities and latest reading resources.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, the CSR coverage has extended to tribal areas of Bharuch District &ndash; covering 18 villages of Netrang and Jhagadia talukas that have 100% tribal population. Main tribes of these villages are Vasava, Chaudhari and Kotwalia. The Foundation has decided to support bamboo craft work of Kotwalia community by providing equipment used in their craft. Also, in Hazira, the Foundation has started working more closely for the welfare of the Halpati &ndash; five villages of are being covered and ten are going to be added.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Initially, they were the land holders and gradually they became labourers in agriculture sector. With low levels of education and employment, as well as deprivation of Govt. schemes due to absence of necessary documents like Aadhar Card/Voter Id etc., it is crucial to bring social development avenues to them. It starts with something as simple but important as facilitating the creation of government documents as well as early engagement with the children to keep a track of their progress from primary to higher education. Plans are underway to include the introduction of skill development, job-related trainings as well as formation of women&rsquo;s SHGs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With learnings from each intervention and every CSR site, the Adani Foundation remains committed to expand its support programme for indigenous peoples.</p>
