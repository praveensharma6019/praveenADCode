        <p>In India, similar rural areas account for a larger part of the geographical area. According to census 2011 report, there are 6.4 lakh villages in India, which shelter more than two-third of the country's population. Provisioning of basic infrastructure facilities for this large section of the population spread across 3.28 million square kilometre of the country's geographical area has been a major challenge. Let’s look at some facts and figures from the ground:</p>
        <p class="pl-3">1.<span> </span>As on March 2020, the length of rural roads is 73% of India’s total road network. The unfortunate reality is that most of these rural roads are in bad shape i.e., they are of poor quality, potholed and unable to withstand the loads of heavy farm equipment, thereby, affecting the rural population’s quality of life and ability of the farmers to transport their catch/produce to the market.<br />
        2.<span> </span>According to 2011 census, there are 246.7 million households in India of which 68% are rural households. Of these, only 53% of household described their houses as being in "good" condition, 41% described them as "liveable" and 6% said they were "dilapidated". <br />
        3.<span> </span>There are a total of 15,07,708 schools in India, out of which 10,32,570 are run by the Union government and state governments, 84,362 are government-aided, 3,37,499 are unaided private school, while 53,277 are run by other organisations and institutions. Schools in rural areas lack in terms of the number of classrooms, availability of safe drinking water facilities, toilet facilities etc.<br />
        4.<span> </span>As per the reports from Census 2011, merely 30% rural areas are covered with tap water supply. </p>
        <p>The above-mentioned gaps in the rural infrastructure need to be addressed properly and as fast as possible to achieve redistributive growth and alleviate poverty in the country. To contribute towards bridging these gaps, Adani Foundation has taken various proactive steps to boost village development works through projects under its Community Infrastructure Development (CID) vertical. This includes Water Conservation and Water Harvesting projects, Health and Sanitation projects, and Roads and Schools related infrastructural projects.</p>
        <p>These are implemented in nearby villages of Adani Group’s business location, covering more than 2,400 villages in 16 Indian states. In all processes, starting from selection of project, planning, designing, execution and finally at the time of handing over, the community is involved. Sustainability is ensured because community members and local government bodies take charge of the operation and maintenance in the future. Rural infrastructure work is not a one-time intervention for building assets. Its impact is relayed on many other social-economic aspects which ultimately uplifts lives and standard of living at the grassroots level.</p>
