      Value: <p>Developing the necessary supportive infrastructure in Dhamra port periphery was a topmost concern for Adani Foundation. A need assessment was done in consultation with government and the PRI members and then work was prioritized as per the immediate need. Starting in 2016, the Foundation supported road construction of a total of 8.1 km. Also, 113 handpumps were installed to meet drinking as well as domestic water requirement. Through collaboration with existing govt. scheme (MO School Abhiyan – Government of Odisha), the Foundation extended support for construction of 7 classrooms and 32 girls’ toilet in government schools of neighbouring villages. Other miscellaneous activities include roof water proofing, high mast light support at fish market etc. Through these interventions, Adani Foundation touched the life of about 5 lakh people in and around Dhamra region.</p>
