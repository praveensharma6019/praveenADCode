        <p>Karim Umar Mansuri is the only Namda artisan in Kutch (Gujarat) &ndash; a place that once was home to this art form. The families in this region are traditionally involved animal husbandry, owning large herds of livestock. Thus, the art of crafting Namda using sheep wool was handed down form fathers to sons. Rolling and felting sheep wool with his father as a child, Karim did not know that he would become the custodian of a specialty art.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>However, in a quickly changing and modernizing world, looking after a family of 11 members doesn&rsquo;t come easy to an artisan. As the sole bread earner, Karim found it very difficult to practice an art form that was struggling to survive in a dwindling market. Unable to depend on Namda as a source of income, he underwent a huge debt and was forced to start looking for menial jobs. This led him to shift to carpentry and pursue Namda only as a passion project that kept his family&rsquo;s legacy alive. During this time, many organizations were keen to help revive Namda but none seemed promising enough for him to devote all his time to the art.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        In 2017, Adani Foundation &ndash; the CSR arm of the Adani Group &ndash; came to know about the Namda Kala. Impressed by the intricacy of the art form the team reached out to Karim. After understanding how the artifacts are made, the Foundation decided to help sustain Namda. Later in that year, the Adani Group placed an order of 750 Namda camels, worth INR 5-5.5 lakhs. To complete this order and for Namda Kala to reach more people, Adani Foundation got 30-35 artisans onboard. In addition to this, the Foundation also supported Karim in converting his kutcha studio into pucca one where he personally trained the said artisans and together, they were able to complete the order. Soon after, he was approached by professors and students from renowned design schools like NID and NIFT.&nbsp;</p>
