        Through Adani Foundation&rsquo;s relentless drive and Karim&rsquo;s passion, the story of Namda Kala has achieved international recognition. Today, he is living debt-free and is able to make ends meet. A closely-guarded family secret of Namda, which was about to disappear due to lack of opportunities, is now a source of <a href="https://www.adanifoundation.org/Our-Work/Sustainable-Livelihood" target="_blank">sustainable livelihood</a>. Karim feels fortunate to have met people who understand and appreciate the art form that has been in his family since the 1800s. &ldquo;With the support of people who believe in you, anything is possible. I am happy that even in adverse situations I did not give up on the kala that has been in my family for generations.&rdquo;<br />
        <br />
        Adani Foundation, through its CSR intervention, has been working to establish new linkages and secure the future of Namda in Kutch. Its efforts stem from the belief that the sustainable development of any community entails furthering its traditional arts and crafts, offering sustainable livelihood interventions that accord dignity of life and living to artisans as well as longevity to the art.&nbsp;<br />
