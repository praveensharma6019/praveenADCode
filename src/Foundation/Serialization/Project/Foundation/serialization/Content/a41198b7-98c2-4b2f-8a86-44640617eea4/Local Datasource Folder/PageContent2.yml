        <p>With Gyanodaya taking over the schools of Godda, the next initiative on agenda was that of skill development. To stop impoverishment, the Adani Foundation runs <a href="https://www.adanifoundation.org/Our-Work/Saksham"> Adani Skill Development Centres </a> (ASDC) across all its CSR sites under the Saksham project. The project works in line with the Government’s Skill India Mission, often partnering with the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and working to bring benefits of partnerships with various corporates and other organizations. Thus, Saksham contributes towards nation-building by increasing employability. </p>
        <p>Phoolo Jhano Saksham Ajeevika Sakhi Mandal (PJSASM) is once such noteworthy, job-oriented women’s self-help group (SHG) in Godda, Jharkhand facilitated by Adani Skill Development Centre. A total of 2,500 women have enrolled in the SHG so far and of these 1,600 are currently active members. These women across 17 villages have received a 3-month training in tailoring, empowering them to become self-reliant. In 2019, with 16 production houses, this SHG was awarded the first order from the district administration for stitching and delivering 4 lakh pairs of school uniform at the cost of Rs. 12 Cr for Government School students in the district. And this was just the beginning.</p>
        <p>The financial independence of women engaged in PJSASM is beneficial for their family’s economic condition – the project has helped more than 5,000 indirect beneficiaries. More importantly, this has boosted their self-confidence and increased their involvement in decision-making matters.</p>
        <p>As the residents of the tribal district take charge of their own future, the Adani Foundation has also stepped up to further augment their economic growth. In this regard, the foundation has taken the responsibility of renovating local infrastructure, deepening ponds, reservoirs and maintaining the hand pumps for local communities. These efforts are supplemented by initiatives like running <a href="https://www.adanifoundation.org/Our-Work/Saksham"> mobile healthcare units</a> (MHCUs) for doorstep medical services, <a href="https://www.adanifoundation.org/Our-Work/Swachhagraha">Swachhagraha</a>for promoting a culture of cleanliness and <a href="https://www.adanifoundation.org/Our-Work/SuPoshan">SuPoshan</a> for alleviating malnutrition and anaemia. The foundation takes immense pride in facilitating the journey of local villagers, strengthening its vision for a growingly prosperous Godda. </p>
