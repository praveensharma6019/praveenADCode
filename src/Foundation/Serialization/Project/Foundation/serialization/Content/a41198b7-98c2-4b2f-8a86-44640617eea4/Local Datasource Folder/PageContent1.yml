        <p>One such initiative is Gyanodaya – a digital learning mission based on the philosophy of ‘education for all’. It was launched in July 2018 through a collaboration between Adani Foundation, Godda district administration and Eckovation Solutions Pvt. Ltd, to promote e-learning in middle and secondary schools. It is transforming the lives of thousands of students residing in the tribal district, showing that the huge gap between urban and rural education systems can be, and has begun to be, bridged with technology. As per the results of Jharkhand’s class X exams, Godda district's rank improved from 21st (2018) to 14th (2019) to 11th this year (2020). The passing percentage rose from 50.7% to 66.7% and now 75.1%, respectively.</p>
        <p>The project currently covers more than 266 government schools of Godda spread across 266 villages in 9 blocks, reaching out to over 70,000 students studying in classes 6th to 12th. In a welcome move, Gyanodaya classes are being aired on Doordarshan Jharkhand from 11th May, 2020. With the telecast on DD Jharkhand, more than 50 lakh students of classes 6th to 12th across the state are able to continue their education amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
