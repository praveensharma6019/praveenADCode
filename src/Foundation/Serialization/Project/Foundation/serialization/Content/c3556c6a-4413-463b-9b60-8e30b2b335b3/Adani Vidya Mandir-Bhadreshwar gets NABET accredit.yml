        <br />
        <strong>Ahmedabad, 26 March 2022:</strong> Adani Vidya Mandir at Bhadreshwar (AVMB) in Mundra, run by the Adani Foundation, has become the first school affiliated to the Gujarat State Education Board (GSEB) to be accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET) under the Quality Council of India (QCI). Adani Vidya Mandir (AVM) is a successful model the Foundation has replicated at various locations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>AVMB is a unique Gujarati medium co-educational school started in June 2012 with an objective to provide free education to children of fishermen and poor families. Its journey was envisioned by Dr Priti G. Adani, Chairperson of the Adani Foundation, for one of the remotest parts of the state. The school is &lsquo;an ideal temple of learning&rsquo; for those children who have talent and extraordinary calibre but face financial challenges.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s a day boarding school that provides free quality education, nutritious food for breakfast and lunch, uniforms, textbooks, notebooks and other educational facilities. The school boasts of a state-of-the-art building, which is airy and well-ventilated. It has designated inspiring activity centres, smart classrooms, library, computer and science labs, art and craft room, music room, etc. The lush green, smart campus challenges and motivates the students to realise their potential and become successful and responsible citizens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>AVMB started preparing for NABET accreditation in 2019-20 amid the Covid pandemic. It began following the school manual covering all aspects of the system, adapting quality objectives in line with the school&rsquo;s vision and mission, introducing changes in the existing system for better effectiveness and transparency, implementing 360˚ feedback mechanism in the teaching processes, developing an annual curriculum plan to bring contextualization in the teaching-learning process, and understanding the needs of the interested parties and fulfilling the quality objectives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>AVMB was able to implement the standards laid by QCI and faced readiness assessment-cum-final assessment in February 2022. It proved its excellence by getting NABET accreditation in March 2022. The school has communicated to all its stakeholders that a school, which offers free education, can become the symbol of academic and human excellence by following high standards set by the nation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This accreditation has led the school to conceptualise national curricular objectives in school processes, bring quality improvement in the existing school system, deliver quality education, design performance measurement and evaluation methods, provide holistic education helping students to realise their potential, establish quality culture that motivates staff, integrate scientific and systematic approach towards teaching, ensure&nbsp; efficient and improved work environment and work satisfaction, take regular feedback on performance through internal and external assessments, and identify risk and opportunities by SWOT analysis of the school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Principal of Adani Vidya Mandi, Bhadreshwar,&nbsp; Lally Sukumaran, said, &ldquo; Getting NABET accreditation has made the school system-driven. It has helped us to benchmark innovative practices so that we are able to bring improvement in the quality and standard of education while preparing each student for life and career.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
