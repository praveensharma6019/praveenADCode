        <strong>Ahmedabad, 30 March 2022:</strong> The Adani Foundation received the 3rd National Water Award from the Ministry of Jal Shakti in the category of Best Industry for CSR activities at Plenary Hall, VIGYAN Bhawan, New Delhi, on 29 March 2022.</p>
        <p>The award ceremony was conducted in the presence of President Shri Ramnath Kovind, Minister of State for Jal Shakti and Food Processing Industries, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, and Minister of State for Jal Shakti and Tribal Affairs, Shri Bishwesar Tudu.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Foundation has done immense work in water conservation and management. In the 62 villages of Mundra in Kutch, it has installed 115 units of rooftop rainwater harvesting (RRWH) structures under its project &lsquo;Swajal&rsquo;, recharged 31 wells and 189 borewells, deepened 56 ponds, constructed 21 check dams and bunds, and established 1,505 drip irrigation systems.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under the leadership of Chairperson Dr Priti G Adani, the Adani Foundation has done extensive work to conserve and manage water, impacting 218,500 men, women, children and senior citizens. The rigorous work undertaken by the Foundation has resulted in reducing total dissolved solids (TDS) in the groundwater by 19.6%, increasing the groundwater table by 4.2 feet in the last five years, water levels by 15-20 feet through borewell recharging facilities and storage capacities of check dams and ponds by 106.44 MCFT, benefitting 2,857 hectares.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Foundation&rsquo;s interventions have helped families save up to Rs 10,000 each. There has been 80% reduction in money spent on labour, 20% increase in net irrigated area, up to 40% increase in &lsquo;Agriculture Aid&rsquo; and 20% rise in revenue. Now, 50% less water is used as compared to conventional methods. Annually, 10,000 litres of water are saved. Potable water is now available at doorstep. Earlier, women used to walk 1.3 kms on an average to fetch water. The availability of water has also ensured safety, security and overall well-being of women and children in the area. There has been up to 25% decrease in expenses on healthcare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The initiatives undertaken and efforts made by the Adani Foundation continue to provide sustainable solutions for the community for their improved farming and ease of living.</p>
