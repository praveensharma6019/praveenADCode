        </strong><br />
        <strong>Ahmedabad, 5 January 2022:</strong> The Adani Foundation, the social development arm of the Adani Group, and the Government of Gujarat have signed an MoU on Project Udaan, under which exposure tours will be organised for school and college students (technical and non-technical) to visit and explore Adani Group facilities. The understanding on Project Udaan was signed in the presence of dignitaries of the International Conference of Academic Institutions (ICAI) 2022.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under Project Udaan, the Adani Foundation has been organising student tours from two locations: a two-day educational trip from Ahmedabad to Adani Ports, Adani Power and the Adani Wilmar refinery at Mundra and a one-day educational trip from Surat to the Adani Port at Hazira. These trips provide the students working insights into largescale business operations and also serve to inspire them to dream big in life. So far, 5,261 visits have been conducted in 10 years &ndash; from 2010 to 2019 &mdash; across all locations in India, and 3,49,580 students have visited Adani Group facilities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs Shilin Adani, Trustee, Adani Foundation, said, &ldquo;Learning outside the classroom gives young students a very different and unique perspective. When young minds will think big to become innovators and achievers of tomorrow, it will be a great step forward towards nation-building.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Udaan, an initiative of the Adani Foundation, was inspired by the lifechanging story of Mr Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group. Mr Adani had visited the Kandla port in Gujarat for the first time as a kid. Looking at the expanse of the port, he dreamt of having his own port one day. The rest is history.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Gujarat education department will recommend Project Udaan to all technical colleges, universities and schools (standards 9-12) &ndash; government, grant-in-aid and self-financed. Principals, provosts or placement officers of these institutions can approach the Adani Foundation to schedule an educational trip for their students.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The technical education department will support in arranging online and offline seminars to introduce Project Udaan and other initiatives of the Adani Foundation to the educational institutions. It will also help educational institutions with approvals or permissions if required.</p>
        <p>Since March 2020, this project has been put on hold due to Covid-19. The Adani Foundation will take the decision on when to resume it.&nbsp;</p>
