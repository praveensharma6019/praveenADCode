        <p><strong>Ahmedabad, 12 January 2022:</strong> The Gyanodaya Godda Project, an online initiative transforming education in Jharkhand&rsquo;s Godda district, has received the National e- Governance Award. The project team of Godda SDO Rituraj and Adani CSR received a trophy, a citation and a cheque for Rs one lakh at the 24th National e-Governance Conference in Hyderabad. Union Minister for State for Science &amp; Technology Dr. Jitendra Singh and Telangana Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao presided over the award ceremony.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This award recognizes innovation in education during the Covid pandemic. Notably, the Adani Foundation has been providing quality education to students through smart classes under the guidance of the district administration. The innovative experiment of keeping children educationally engaged through the Gyanodaya App and Gyanodaya Rath, a mobile learning van, proved very effective during the Covid period.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gyanodaya is an online education initiative by the Adani Foundation to help rural students in Jharkhand&rsquo;s Godda district to learn more efficiently. In collaboration with the Godda District Administration and Eckovation Pvt Ltd, it is delivering a cutting-edge interactive curriculum through smart classrooms, furthering Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, i.e., quality education.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gyanodaya has arrested dropout rates, catalysed an increase in attendance rates, and given tangible results of students&rsquo; performance in examinations. The project that began in 2018 has reached 70,000 students across 276 schools in the district. In the 2019-20 class 10 board examination, the passing percentage of the Godda district touched 75%, a whopping improvement from 66% in 2018-19 and 50% in 2017-18. The initiative has also trained teachers from 330 schools to prepare them for 2021-22. Looking at the learning outcomes achieved by the students in this district, the State Government has decided to implement the Gyanodaya model in the entire state.</p>
