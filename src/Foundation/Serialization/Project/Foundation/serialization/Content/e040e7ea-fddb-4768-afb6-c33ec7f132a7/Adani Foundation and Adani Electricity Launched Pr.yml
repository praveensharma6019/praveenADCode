        <p><strong></strong><br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Program will cover 25 BMC schools in and around Chembur</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Mumbai, November 17, 2021:</strong> Adani Foundation, the social development arm of the Adani Group, in association with Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd (AEML) launched one of its successful programs, Utthan, in Mumbai. Utthan aims to foster students&rsquo; learning abilities and better the learning outcomes. It entails adopting government primary schools, tutoring Priya Vidyarthis (progressive learners), arresting dropout rates and collaborating for staff&rsquo;s capacity building. Teachers and parents are brought onboard to enhance foundational learning and numeracy skills among students.&nbsp;<br />
        The program was launched by Dr. Priti Adani, Chairperson, Adani Foundation in the presence of Mr. Vasant Gadhavi, Executive Director, Adani Foundation and the AEML team.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Addressing the gathering, the Chairperson said, &ldquo;The pandemic has created a learning vacuum for students, especially those belonging to underprivileged sections of the society. The launch of Utthan in Mumbai comes at this crucial juncture as we expect schools to reopen soon. The project is designed to bridge the learning gap through holistic support to students, who will be coping up not only with studies but also other personal difficulties. This will be possible when all project stakeholders, including parents, teachers and Sanginis work together to boost the students&rsquo; morale.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        Books on children&rsquo;s wellness (Grades 1 to 8), community mobilization guidelines, English language and Math were unveiled on the occasion. Learning Links Foundation, the Utthan program partner in Mumbai, has set up three priorities &ndash; a) pay attention to children&rsquo;s health-psychosocial wellbeing; b) support them to catch up on learning levels affected by the lack of physical classes, and c) build teachers&rsquo; capacities to help children enhance their learning abilities and outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The program will be launched in 25 BMC schools in Chembur, Mumbai with the following components:<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Holistic development, including wellness practices, hygiene and sanitation, socio-emotional development<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Foundational literacy and numeracy skills for primary / upper primary students&nbsp;<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Support for middle and secondary students with minimum grade-level competencies<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Teachers&rsquo; training to enhance students&rsquo; learning experience&nbsp;<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Community engagement through parental involvement &ndash; enlist mothers as program Sanginis and train them to support the education of their / community children&nbsp;<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Hybrid model (digital and face-to-face) of program delivery to overcome the challenges of the pandemic&nbsp;<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Collaboration with school, community, and specialist institutions for program sustainability&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Utthan aims to cover more schools in Mumbai and build a robust and replicable model to benefit underprivileged communities.&nbsp;</p>
