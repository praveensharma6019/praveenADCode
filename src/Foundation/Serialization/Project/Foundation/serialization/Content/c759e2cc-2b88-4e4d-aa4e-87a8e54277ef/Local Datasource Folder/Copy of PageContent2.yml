        <p style="font-style: italic;   font-size: 14px;  color: #9e9e9e;">Project SuPoshan team members are fully focused on spending time in the beneficiaries' kitchen</p>
        To the Take Home Ration (THR &ndash; bal shakti), Kiranbai added jowar flour, wheat flour, ghee, salt, sesame seeds and a cup of chopped greens. Using water, curd and other cooked vegetables from the previous meal, she prepared a soft dough while explaining to the mother the immense nutritional value of each ingredient for children&rsquo;s growth. She then took a playful Suhani in her lap, caressed her and fed her two theplas. When facts are supported with concern, care and reasoning, the acceptance level multiplies. She counselled Sangita to incorporate dietary diversity and shared more recipes from the project&rsquo;s recipe book. The Sangini&rsquo;s commitment towards the nutritional status of her three children filled the mother with gratitude.&nbsp;
