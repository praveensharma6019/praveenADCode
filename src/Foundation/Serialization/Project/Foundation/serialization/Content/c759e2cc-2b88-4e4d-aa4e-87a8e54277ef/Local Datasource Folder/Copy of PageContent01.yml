        <p style="font-style: italic;   font-size: 14px;  color: #9e9e9e;">Adani Foundation promotes the use of local, seasonal foods based on 3As – availability, accessibility and affordability</p>
        <p>Tackling injustices in food and health systems is challenging &ndash; poor diets and resulting malnutrition are great societal pressures, causing vast health, economic and environmental burdens. Recognizing nutrition as the catalyst that can change the face of India for generations to come, the Adani Foundation has prioritized it. As the corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm of the Adani Group, it has steadfastly pursued the mission of good nutrition to promote holistic community development and reached 5 lakh beneficiaries.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        <a href="https://www.suposhan.in/" target="_blank">Fortune SuPoshan </a>promotes the use of local, seasonal foods to combat malnutrition and anaemia in the underprivileged sections of the society based on 3As &ndash; availability, accessibility, affordability. This includes bringing a sustainable change in cooking and food consumption habits through community health initiatives. The project endeavours to instil a sense of ownership in people &ndash; especially in women &ndash; towards their nutritional status and overall well-being.&nbsp;<br />
        This is done by SuPoshan Sanginis, ie rural healthcare volunteers, who are trained to deliver simple actionable messages in alignment with the needs of infants, children, adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers. They encourage appropriate child rearing and feeding practices while providing a lucid understanding of child development.&nbsp;</p>

        Let me narrate a heart touching story from Mathavadi &ndash; a remote village in Narmada district&rsquo;s Garudeshwar block. Traversing a hilly terrain through undulated paths is not easy but that doesn&rsquo;t hamper SuPoshan Sangini Kiranbai Tadvi. Every single day, she finishes household chores and dresses up in her blue uniform saree. With a SuPoshan kit on her back, she ventures out to visit households in her designated area.&nbsp;</p>
