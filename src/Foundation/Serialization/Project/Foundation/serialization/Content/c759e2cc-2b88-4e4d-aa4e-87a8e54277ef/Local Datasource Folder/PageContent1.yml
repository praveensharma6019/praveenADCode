        <p style="font-style: italic;   font-size: 14px;  color: #9e9e9e;">SuPoshan Sangini Kiranbai Tadvi from Mathavadi village in Narmada district (Gujarat)</p>
        
        <p>During one such home visit in January this year, Kiranbai was assessing 18-month-old Suhani &ndash; Sangita Tadvi&rsquo;s third child. On entering the height and weight in her digital device she saw that Suhani fell under the moderate wasting category. Her conversation with the mother and other family members revealed that their meals lacked essential nutrients despite the availability of many local and seasonal foods that the family could afford &ndash; Suhani&rsquo;s father works as a security guard for a reasonable income. Blame the lack of knowledge, ignorance or excessive commercialization but traditional foods and comprehensive cooking methods have taken a back seat. There is a clear link between household characteristics and infant/young child feeding practices.</p>
        <p>Our Sangini resolved to not let Suhani fall further into severe wasting category. She took the lead to plan the next course of action after quickly consulting the project team &ndash; at Narmada in all the 5 blocks, the team members are fully focused on spending time in the household kitchen of the beneficiaries. After checking the family&rsquo;s taste preferences, Kiranbai decided to make theplas. From the adjoining Poshan Vatika (kitchen garden) developed by the family with guidance from Adani Foundation, the Sangini along with the mother plucked fenugreek, coriander and spinach leaves.&nbsp;</p>
