        <p>This story is representative of a revolution of sorts that the project teams have ushered by entering the beneficiaries&rsquo; kitchens. They are challenging mind sets and giving home-grown solutions that show visible, quantifiable impacts in people&rsquo;s nutritional status over a period of time. Through thorough cooking demonstrations that involve proper washing, cleaning, soaking techniques and information about right combination of foods for proper absorption in the body, the SuPoshan teams are encouraging sustainable living through behavioural change.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The CSR initiatives by Adani Foundation acknowledge that health and nutrition are human rights and that healthy populations are a major prerequisite for productive economies. I would sum up with another quote by Gro Harlem Brundtland &ndash; &ldquo;The dual scourge of hunger and malnutrition will be truly vanquished not only when granaries are full, but also when people's basic health needs are met, and women are given their rightful role in societies.&rdquo;</p>
