        <p><strong>Unique reading resources</strong></p>
        <p>Last two academic years have set in a new normal for the entire country. Since the schools were closed, our Utthan Sahayaks faced difficulties in providing reading resources to young readers. Therefore, they came up with a unique idea. They suggested that kids read toffee and biscuit wrappers, content written on cold drink bottles and village walls, names of shops in their respective villages and so on. This sparked interest in the young ones. By doing this, they also learnt about manufacturers and the importance of the expiry date of products, MRP etc.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>Chaupal pe charcha</strong></p>
        <p>Once the pandemic situation was under control, the state government allowed to conduct sheri shikshan. The Sahayaks started conducting classes at common places like community hall, sarpanch/ parents&rsquo; homes or at chaupal. Thus, making way for the concept, &lsquo;Chaupal pe charcha&rsquo; in which one hour is dedicated to reading, followed by activities under the guidance of Sahayaks. The audience include parents and community members. The reading session includes reading books and newspapers. The Sahayaks also have requested parents to introduce bedtime stories as that would help children develop key life skills, including social and communication abilities. It will help in language development, and their sense of cultural awareness, and also inspire curiosity and imagination in them.&nbsp;</p>
