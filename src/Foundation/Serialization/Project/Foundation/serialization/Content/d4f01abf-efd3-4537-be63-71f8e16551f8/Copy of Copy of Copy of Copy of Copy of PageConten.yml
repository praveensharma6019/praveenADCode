        <p><strong>Cultivating reading culture&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There are Utthan Sahayaks (supplementary teachers) appointed in every school to meet the project objectives. Every second and fourth Saturday, books are issued to each student, especially those of classes 3-8. To make reading interesting, different activities are planned for kids every first and third Saturday. These activities include exposure visits to school/community library, annotation of newspaper, retell the tale, read and enact, bookmark making, book review, character sketch etc. These activities help in drawing students&rsquo; attention towards library.&nbsp;</p>
