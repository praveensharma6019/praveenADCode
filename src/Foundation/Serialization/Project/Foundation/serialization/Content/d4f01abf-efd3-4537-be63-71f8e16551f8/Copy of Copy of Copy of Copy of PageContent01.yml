        <p><strong>Breaking geographical barriers to connect readers</strong></p>
        <p>To make reading more joyful and practical, Utthan schools celebrate International School Library Month (ISLM) every year in the second week of October. After registering the schools for the project, information on partner school for exchanging bookmarks is received. Till date more than 2,500 bookmarks (hardcopy/ digital) with 50 schools from 13 countries (Portugal, Croatia, and Malaysia) have been exchanged. During the pandemic, the rural school students got an opportunity to connect live with one of the oldest schools in Croatia built in 1853. The theme of this live session was &lsquo;Fairy tales and folk tales from around the world&rsquo;. Our students introduced various characters like Tenali Raman, Akbar- Birbal, Krishna and Sudama through various art forms such as puppet show and Bhawaai. They also learnt about the culture and literature of the other country.</p>
