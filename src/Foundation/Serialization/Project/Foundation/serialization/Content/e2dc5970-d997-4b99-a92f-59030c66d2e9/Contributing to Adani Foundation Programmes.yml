        <p class="mb-3">The Adani employees are committed to promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among the community. They actively participate in cleanliness drives, awareness sessions, etc. for projects like Swachhagraha. They passionately volunteer in projects like Udaan to inspire the next generation to dream big. At sites where teaching resources are not readily available, the employees help in training the students of the Saksham programme.</p>
