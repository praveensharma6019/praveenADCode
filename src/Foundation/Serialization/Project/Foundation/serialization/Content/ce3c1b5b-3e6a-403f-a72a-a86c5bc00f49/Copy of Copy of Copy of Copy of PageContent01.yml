        <p>This has helped them to keep in touch with the students virtually amidst the COVID19 induced lockdown and school closure. On a brighter note, it is safe to say that the pandemic has inadvertently accelerated the use of technology in teaching. Both educators and students are comfortable while using technology in teaching learning process &ndash; not to replace in-person learning but rather enhance it. A survey was conducted in October 2020 to know about the virtual teaching learning by Adani school educators, 93% educators stated that they are very comfortable in using the virtual platform, 89.2% Adani educators feel the virtual platform is a blessing for them as they can effectively use different resources and 95.8% educators feel that they could enhance their professional skills due to virtual platform.</p>
        <p>Recently, the Adani Vidya Mandir, Ahmedabad (AVMA) had conducted a Staff Empowerment Week to equip the educators according to the guidelines given by NEP 2020. The educators were trained to efficiently shift the teaching-learning to inquiry based, critical thinking, cognitive learning and applied methods. They understand that good teaching is more about asking the right questions than seeking the right answers. As a school with distinct mark of quality awarded by National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET), Quality Council of India, it has conducted a series of training sessions for all other schools run by Adani Foundation.</p>
        <p>AVMA has thoughtfully designed a growth plan for this academic session which caters to student centric education, creativity, scientific temperament with practical application, inclusion of skill subjects and systematic career guidance process. The primary classes are involved in conducting a systematic action research, strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills. Every student is assessed through fun activities, the outcome of which leads to tweaking the lesson plans accordingly. The students at AVMA are encouraged to participate in various competitive examinations which encourages them to lead towards their career dreams. This approach is making the foundation of the students very strong.</p>
