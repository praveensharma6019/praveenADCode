        <p>As state-wise restrictions are eased on opening schools, we hope to welcome all children back to classrooms, and go back to interacting like the pre-covid times. It is very important to ensure that students across the country return to school &ndash; because not getting that opportunity will rob them of their potential future. Ensuring that will be the biggest tribute we can pay to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and honour his vision for India.&nbsp;</p>
