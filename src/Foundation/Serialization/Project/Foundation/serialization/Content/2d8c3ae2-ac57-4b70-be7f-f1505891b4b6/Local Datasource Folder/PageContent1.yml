        <p>Shortly after her joining the force, the coronavirus outbreak took India by a storm, forcing a majority of Indians to be locked down in their homes in order to stay healthy and safe. However, certain workers are reporting to duty each day, in the face of a highly contagious pandemic. Amongst such healthcare providers and government servants, are people like Lilaba who are ensuring that law and order is maintained. She is posted in Mundra Town to strictly monitor the lockdown – she is serving the nation while her husband stays home to take care of their kids.</p>
        
        <p>From a homemaker to a corona warrior, Lilaba has come a long way, becoming self-sufficient and leading her life with utmost confidence. Today, she is not only earning a living for her family but also respect from her community. She shares, “Adani foundation acted as a compass in my life. It helped me navigate through troublesome waters and gave me a direction. I am an entirely new person today. And while I do my duty, I request everyone to stay home and be safe”.</p>
