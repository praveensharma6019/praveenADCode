        <p>It has been more than a year since we first saw the outbreak of COVID-19. We are witnessing a massive surge in coronavirus infections again &ndash; four months after the spread had seemed to slow down. India has reported more than 300,000 daily cases since the last three weeks. This &ldquo;second wave&rdquo; has engulfed the country and amidst a deadly shortage of resources, the frontline workers are battling every single day in order to save lives.</p>
        <p>G.K. General Hospital (GKGH) is the attached teaching hospital to the Gujarat Adani Institute of Medical Sciences (GAIMS). It is the only and the largest district hospital in Kutch &ndash; our country&rsquo;s largest district. GKGH is often the last ray of hope for thousands of patients from different parts of the district. The government has defined three categories of COVID-19 facilities, according to which GKGH falls in the category of &ldquo;Dedicated COVID-19 Hospital with ICU Facility&rdquo; since March 2020.&nbsp;</p>
