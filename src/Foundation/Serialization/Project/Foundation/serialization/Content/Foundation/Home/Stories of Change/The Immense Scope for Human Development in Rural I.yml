        <p>68 years old Premila Maity has been living in Dhamra’s Narshighprasad village of Dosinga Gram Panchayat for more than 50 years. It is only in 2017 that she saw a pukka/CC road in her vicinity. Now, younger members in her family and community can venture out for work easily and children studying at the Narshingprasad UGME School don’t face obstacles in reaching the campus, even during heavy monsoon season.</p>
        <p>In many such villages near Dhamra (Odisha), people live in small hamlets in groups of 10 to 20 households. These are very underprivileged communities which depend purely on fishing and day to day labour work to earn their living. The existing infrastructure facilities are not up to the mark, which are essential to help them to avail healthcare services, education, livelihood opportunities and to transport their agricultural produce or fish catch to the market.</p>
