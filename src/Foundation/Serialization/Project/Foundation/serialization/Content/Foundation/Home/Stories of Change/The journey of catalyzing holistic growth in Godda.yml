        <p>The success story of Adani Foundation’s initiatives is crafted through sustainable behavioural change in communities who take ownership. To illustrate how fueling holistic development leads to communities transforming their own lives, let’s take the instance of the foundation-led projects in Godda, Jharkhand. The Godda district is declared ‘aspirational’ by Niti Ayog – it is one of the 115 such districts identified across 28 states of India for enhancement of the Human Development Index and reduction in the significant inter-state and inter-district variations in development.</p> 
        
        <p>Essentially, these aspirational districts hold the aspirations of many people yearning to learn, earn and achieve. India currently has the highest young population – half its population is below 25 years of age. To reap its demographic dividend, the country needs to harness the potential of young people. A way forward in achieving this is ensuring quality education and skill development opportunities for them. Ensuring equal opportunities and upholding basic human rights of a community is not only beneficial to them, but to the nation at large, accelerating economic growth and implementing sustainable development. </p>
