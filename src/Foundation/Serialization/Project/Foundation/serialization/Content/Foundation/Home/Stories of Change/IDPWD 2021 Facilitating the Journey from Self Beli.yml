        <p>“There's none so blind as those who will not listen.” These words of author Neil Gaiman are very profound. With our ears to the ground, we endeavour to listen as closely as possible. Socially and economically marginalized sections of the society are on select focus of our CSR efforts and a major part of mainstreaming those on the fringes includes enabling the differently-abled by contributing towards a world which is inclusive and accessible.</p>
        <p>When our team members of Adani Foundation (Mundra) are out and about for field work, they meet many differently-abled persons. Over a period of time, it became important for us to understand what may help them to lead their life with dignity and chalk out a systematic action plan. It was frequently observed that many of them were not aware about beneficial government schemes and so, bridging this gap to bring much-needed aid and relief was the natural first step. </p>
        <p>Based on our guiding principle of fostering purposeful partnerships with government agencies and using our experience gathered while running livelihood and skill-development projects, the Foundation has been making enduring efforts to empower the differently-abled population in Kutch district of Gujarat over the last five years. This journey of sharpening our approach has been a rewarding one, which I would like to illustrate through a few case studies.</p>
