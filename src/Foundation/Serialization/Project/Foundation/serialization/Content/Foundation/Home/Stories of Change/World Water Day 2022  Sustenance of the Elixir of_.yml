      Hint: Description
      Value: |
        <p>Water covers approximately 75% of the Earth’s surface. In scientific parlance, water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odourless, and nearly colourless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of earth’s hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms. It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. An invisible resource that sustains life, groundwater is fast depleting. It is important that we, as responsible and aware citizens, play an active role in taking care of it, recharging it and making it available to those who do not have access to safe water. </p>
        <p>Groundwater caters to almost half of all drinking water requirements the world over. About 40% is used for irrigation and 1/3 is needed for industry. The theme of World Water Day 2022 is “Groundwater: Making the invisible visible”.   </p>
        <p>India's total annual utilizable water resources is 1123 BCM (690 BCM surface water + 433 BCM ground water). Being an agrarian country, irrigation by far is the largest user of India’s water reserve with usage of 78% of total water reserve, followed by domestic sector (6%) and industrial sector (5%). Groundwater is also a major source for drinking, domestic and industrial usage in urban and rural India. 45% of total irrigation and 80% of domestic water come from groundwater reserve. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells.</p>
        <p>The main source of ground water is the recharge from monsoon precipitation. About 58% of country’s annual rechargeable groundwater is contributed by monsoon rainfall. Other sources of recharge like seepage from canals, tanks, ponds and other water structures and irrigation account for about 32%.</p>
