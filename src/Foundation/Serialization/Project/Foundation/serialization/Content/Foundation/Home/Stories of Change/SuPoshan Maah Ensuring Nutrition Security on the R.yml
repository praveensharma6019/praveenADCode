      Value: |
        <p>COVID-19 has led to severe and widespread increase in global food insecurity, affecting underprivileged households in almost every country, with impacts expected to continue through 2021, into 2022 and possibly beyond as the Delta variant continues to spread. The deadly second wave took away earning members of many families, leaving many households vulnerable and struggling for basic necessities. Dietary diversity has decreased significantly and resulted in adverse effects on maternal and child nutrition.</p>
        <p>As per the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS)* data, in India 51% mothers had received 4 antenatal care visits, 14% non-breastfeeding children aged 6-23 months had received adequate diet, 21% children under 5 years were found as wasted, 36% children were found as underweight, 38% children were found as stunted and 53% women under 15-49 years were found as anaemic. This was the harsh reality in India, even before COVID hit in March 2020. In a recent interview**, Arjan De Wagt, Head, Nutrition, UNICEF India, notes that for the future of children in India, controlling COVID-19 and ending malnutrition are equally important and urgent.</p>
        <p>Unless nutrition is prioritized at all levels and by all stakeholders, communities will continue to suffer. Recognizing the gravity of the situation and considering the devastating grip of the second wave of COVID-19, CSR initiatives of Adani Foundation leapt into action as soon as it was possible to do so. Throughout the lockdown period, our Sanginis under the flagship Fortune SuPoshan project, were conducting tele-counselling sessions for pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls. They provided the beneficiaries emotional support to cope with the unsettling circumstances and disseminated correct information on consuming nutritious food, availing government services, and activated emergency referral services. They also supported various Government initiatives such as vaccination drives, linkage to Government schemes/benefits and developed their own skills through virtual training programs.</p>
