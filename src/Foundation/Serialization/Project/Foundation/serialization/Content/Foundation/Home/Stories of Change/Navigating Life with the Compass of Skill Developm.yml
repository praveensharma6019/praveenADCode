        <p>Jyoti Goswami has shown that no matter how big the storm is, one can muster up the courage to face it like an eagle and fly above it. Her story serves as an inspiration to many young women who want to lead a life of self-reliance and dignity. </p> 
        
        <p>As a young student, Jyoti was fully engrossed in her academics and faring quite well, only to be stopped from pursing higher studies. Her mother announced that irrespective of whether or not she passes her HSC exams, she will not be allowed to study further and that marriage was on the cards. Like many girls in India, Jyoti gave up on her dreams and got married at a young age. She took up the responsibilities of being a wife and a homemaker – living a happy life with her husband and two children – until her husband passed away. Her small world was in complete dismay and disarray.</p>
        
        <p>The responsibility of providing for their two children fell on her shoulders. Worse still, her in-laws asked her to leave the house, depriving her off any moral or financial support. Jyoti took shelter in her brother’s home and started looking for opportunities that could help to fend for her family. Unfortunately, because of the lack of higher education and a solid skillset, she had to struggle a lot. She tried her luck by pursuing a teaching job but the income was meagre. The thought of being a burden to her brother coupled with insufficient funds for children’s schooling made her nervous and distraught. She was sorry for not being able to provide an environment in which her children could learn and grow up happily. </p>
