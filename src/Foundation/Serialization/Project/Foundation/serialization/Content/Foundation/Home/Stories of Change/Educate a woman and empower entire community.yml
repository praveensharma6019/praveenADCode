        <p>To call women a weaker sex is a libel; it is man&rsquo;s injustice to women. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably man&rsquo;s superior.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        --Mahatma Gandhi</p>
        <p>Gandhiji believed that women&rsquo;s education was as important as that of men. According to him, education empowers women to uphold their rights, enables them to get employment, improves their financial condition, and enhances their ability to care for their families.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        At the Adani Foundation, we too believe in empowering women, their families, and the entire community. The women empowerment initiatives focus on providing rural women opportunity to make proper use of the choices, opportunities, and spaces available to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Keeping this in mind, a women&rsquo;s empowerment initiative was undertaken at the CSR site of Surguja in Chhatisgarh through formation of Mahila Udyami Bahuddeshiy Sahkari Samiti (MUBSS). The women&rsquo;s cooperative was initiated with the goal of &ldquo;empowering rural women through skill development for gainful economic engagement and enabling them to command dignity in society and their institutionalisation in Women&rsquo;s Cooperative Society for their socio-economic development&rdquo;. It focuses on creating a multidimensional impact on the lives of the rural women by mobilising them into cooperative society and enhancing their capability and risk-taking capacity. The ultimate goal is to improve the social and economic status of the families of the women associated with the cooperative society by providing better education, better health and hygiene and social cohesiveness and harmony.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        MUBSS was formed with 250 women of 5 villages and activities such as spice grinding, sanitary pad production, vermicomposting, mid-day meal, white phenyl production and wheat grinding were implemented to empower them. The project has provided livelihood support, enhanced skills of SHG members and improved their social status in villages. The women are economically engaged through MUBSS and earn a monthly income in the range of Rs 3,000 to 12,000 depending on their skills and working ability. They utilise the money to buy personal assets. It helps them to be financially self- reliant.</p>
