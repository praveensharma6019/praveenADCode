      Hint: Description
      Value: |
        After pioneering a series of educational institutions in Gujarat, it was a providential leap for me to join Adani Foundation, the CSR arm of Adani Group, in January 2018. I experienced a distinct world here &ndash; one dedicated to transforming the lives of the underserved &ndash; a mission from the heart.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our education system, depriving many the opportunities for growth and development. Though the innovative ways to deliver remote learning are reaching the middle class and the elite, the children from the underprivileged households are left out, thus striking further inequity in education. Providing these children with effective platforms to avoid learning shortfalls along with mental health and psychosocial support has been Adani Foundation&rsquo;s priority in education since April 2020.&nbsp;
