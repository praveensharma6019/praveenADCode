        <p class=" mb-3">Adani Foundation operates Mobile Health Care Units (MHCUs), providing on-the-spot medical assistance to patients in far-flung regions. The MHCUs are serving people in remote villages, thereby ensuring that quality health care services reach the doorsteps of needy groups. These services have been successful in not only treating the patients and generating awareness, but it has also helped the beneficiaries to save money and time which they would have otherwise spent on transportation, consultation and medicines.</p>
