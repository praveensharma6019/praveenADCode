      Value: |
        <p>Picture this &ndash; as per the Food and Agricultural Association (FAO), India ranks first in milk production and second in agriculture production globally. In 2020, agriculture contributed to 23% of the country&rsquo;s GDP and according to World Bank, more than 50% of Indian families are dependent on agriculture for livelihood. 96 million hectares of land is under irrigation in our country &ndash; highest in the world!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The favourbale geography, geology and climate coupled with strong rail and road networks have made India a largely agricultural economy. Further, good government policies like support for drip irrigation, solar pumps, formation of Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) to provide financial support to farmers, FPCs through NABARD, lead banks, establishing Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) at all districts&rsquo; level, presence of bodies like National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), Food Corporation of India (FCI), Indian Council of Agricultural Research &ndash; these contribute a lion&rsquo;s share towards our agricultural prowess. At the same time, the strong presence of AMUL and National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) are ensuring that dairy farmers&rsquo; interests are protected and returns are optimums.</p>
        <p>So, while we should already be the global leader in agriculture, we&rsquo;re not quite there. Let&rsquo;s look at some facts to illustrate this.&nbsp;<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>As of 2020, India processes less than 10% of its agricultural output.&nbsp;<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>60% of the overall agriculture GDP is contributed by horticulture and dairy; but only 20% area of the total agricultural land is under horticulture.&nbsp;<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Out of 173.4 million hectare agricultural land, 78% is marginal land holding (below 1 hectares) and 14% is between 1 and 2 hectares.&nbsp;<br />
        &bull;<span> </span>Lack of proper storage facility for food grains causes more than 5-15% losses during pre/post-harvest</p>
        <p>Additionally, unplanned cropping pattern, unorganized market for horticulture produce and lack of processing facilities are problems due to which farmers suffer.</p>
