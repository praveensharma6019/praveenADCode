        From sculptures and dance forms to paintings and textile art, India is known for its long and varied history of culturally rich art forms. One such art form, older than the art of spinning and weaving, is Namda Kala. Derived from the Sanskrit word Namata meaning woolen artifact, it is the art of making felted floor coverings and paddings, and then embroidering the pieces with hand-dyed threads.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        The Namda artifacts are predominantly made of pure sheep wool. In the 1800s and 1900s, their demand was high across India, given their usage in the royal families. The kings and minsters were regular patrons of Namda, making it one the most recognizable art form that was handed down from one generation to the next. Majorly used as seating paddings on elephant and camel rides, these artifacts saw its peak and utmost glory during the dynasty era. With the government placing bulk orders and fairs still prevalent in the country, Namda Kala continued to enjoy its fair share of market waves till the late 1900s and even the early 2000s.&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Gradually, the understanding of the art started to fade away and new art forms took over. This resulted in not only the Namda artisans switching to other art forms but in some cases even switching to other occupations. Despite this shift, a handful of artisans held on to their family legacy of Namda Kala. This is the story of one such adept artisan who hails from Mundra.&nbsp;
