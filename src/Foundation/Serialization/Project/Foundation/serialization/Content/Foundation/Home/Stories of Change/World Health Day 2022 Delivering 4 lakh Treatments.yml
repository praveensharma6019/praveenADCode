        <p>On World Health Day 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) has focused global attention on urgent actions needed to keep humans and the planet healthy and foster a movement to create societies focused on well-being. The Adani Foundation has been striving for two decades now, to make a spectrum of quality healthcare services available to the underprivileged sections of the society in remote areas. In this bid, is delivers 4 lakh treatments annually, across India &ndash; through hospitals, rural health centres, health camps and mobile healthcare units.</p>
        <p>In a country like ours, patients and their families bear a heavy burden due to the absence of quality healthcare facilities and infrastructure. For example, getting regular dialysis for kidney related ailment can be very expensive. However, between 2011 &ndash; 2020 the Adani Foundation has helped many to get regular dialysis at a minimal and affordable charges. Take for instance Ramzan Adam hailing from Mundra&rsquo;s Juna Bandar vicinity, who had lost all hopes when he was diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago. Weekly travelling from Mundra to Bhuj for dialysis became a painful routine. His main source of income came from fishing but due to his dialysis he had to skip work for days.&nbsp;</p>
