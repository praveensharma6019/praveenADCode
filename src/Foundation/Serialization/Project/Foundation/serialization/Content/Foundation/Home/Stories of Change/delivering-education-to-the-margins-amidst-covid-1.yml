        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>On a wintery morning in Navinal, Bhuj, located in the western Indian state of Gujarat, 8-year-old Sunita wakes up rubbing her eyes. She tells her mother Champa Sathavara that she wants to &ldquo;go to school&rdquo;, prodding her to telephone her teacher Hasbai Gadhavi. These days, school refers to the makeshift home-visits, under which students of a neighbourhood like Sunita, gather to learn from an Utthan Sahayak like Hasbai on every alternate day of the week.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Hasbai is involved in the Adani Foundation-run Project Utthan as an academic resource for Navinal Primary School, who aids priya vidyarthis (progressive learners) to pursue their studies, even amidst the coronavirus crisis. The project entails adopting government primary schools, tutoring students who are lagging behind academically during the early childhood education, arresting the dropout rates and collaborating to enhance the staff&rsquo;s teaching capabilities.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>According to the World Economic Forum, a total of 320 million learners in India have been adversely affected by the pandemic and have transitioned to e-learning. This transition has not been possible for all students, and even educators, due to unequal access to the internet and technology. A recent survey by India's National Statistics Office suggests that only 15% of kids in rural areas have access to the internet, compared to 42% in urban areas.</span></p>
