        <p>On October 22, 2021, Saksham &ndash; the skill-development initiative of Adani Foundation &ndash; touched a huge milestone. The trainee count hit 80,000! This has been an eventful journey, in being a part of so many lives, lives which illustrate real transformation. We are proud to be readying skilled human resources for a developing nation like ours. On one hand, India is focusing on enhancing the quality of education with the introduction of the National Education Policy 2021, and on the other, a top-down push is being applied for skill development courses to equip youth with employability and entrepreneurship skills. And in my experience, unemployment is more often the result of a lack of skills, and not a lack of jobs.</p>
        <p>The success of any national or global efforts cannot be achieved without the youngsters being actively involved. To give a more relevant example, let me share some insights about the immediate need of healthcare workers which COVID19 gave rise to. When the entire world came to a standstill and every individual was anxious amidst the panic created by the pandemic, we at ASDC were frantically trying to identify as many people as possible, who can work as frontline healthcare workers. Over 3,000 people were approached and to our surprise, the age group which accepted the challenge was as young as 18 to 24 (out of the age group of 18-56).</p>
        <p>Of course, livelihood generation matters, but this situation was unprecedented. The will and zeal among the youth to contribute to the nation even in such adversities &ndash; is what defines the New India for me. The young India. This young brigade not only served covid patients, but they also share innovative ideas for monitoring patient care and management of hospitals. So, our demographic dividend is ready to accept challenges, but the data tells a different tale. Statistical data shows that the youth unemployment rate in India is going higher year-by-year though there are some positive signs for the overall unemployment rate among all age groups.</p>
