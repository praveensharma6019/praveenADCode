        <p>Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad was a great educationist long before he served the country as independent India&rsquo;s first Education Minister. His birth anniversary on 11th November is commemorated and observed as National Education Day every year. The pioneer of University Grant Commission, All India Council for Technical Education, Kharagpur Institution of Higher Education, The University Education Commission and The Secondary Education Commission had dreamt about providing free primary education across India. New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has given further extension to his contribution, which upon implementation will bring much needed and awaited educational reforms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NEP 2020 has introduced new dimensions to the education sector in India. Schools run by the Adani Foundation grabbed the opportunity to delve into the minute and important details of the policy and started aligning its educational strategies accordingly. Keeping the students at the center, the schools have thoughtfully designed the action plan for the months and years to come. The teaching fraternity is very well trained at all levels to take the new policy ahead. The staff recruitment process is also fine-tuned to ensure that we bring the right educators on board.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The training needs for the academic session were identified keeping in view the expectations of NEP 2020. They are trained to use innovative ways for teaching-learning as well as assessment and evaluation. Every assessment is analyzed based on different parameters to get a 360⁰ view. A training was provided to conduct &ldquo;assessment as learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;assessment for learning&rdquo;. Our educators believe that the assessment is not for judging the students, but it is an opportunity to know their students in all aspects.&nbsp;</p>
