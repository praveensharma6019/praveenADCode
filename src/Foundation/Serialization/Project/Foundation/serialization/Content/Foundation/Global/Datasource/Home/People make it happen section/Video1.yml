        <h3>Our People- <span class="d-block">Who make it happen</span></h3>
        							<p>When Umendra Sahu, #AdaniFoundation, visited a small village in Chhattisgarh, he realised there was a lot of unused land being wasted affecting the income of the villagers; so he decided to do something about it. This is a story of one of our #HeroesAtWork who inspired an entire community to rise above its potential and make the best use of the land. Umendra is one of those precious few who showed the conviction to bring in a real change and find the hero within, paving the way for more to follow.</p>
