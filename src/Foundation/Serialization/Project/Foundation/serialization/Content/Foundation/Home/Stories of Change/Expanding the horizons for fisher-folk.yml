      Hint: Description
      Value: |
        <p>For fishermen, life revolves around the sea, fishes and the fishing nets – one such settlement of fishermen is in the coastal village of Mundra in Gujarat. It used to lack access to even the most basic infrastructure. Even though the fishermen community has been fishing here since 100 years, they did not have facilities such as shelter, means of transport or access to potable water. Naturally, their topmost concern was always related to their equipment which is essential for them to earn a livelihood. As for the rest, they would make-do with temporary arrangement and survive.  </p> 
        
        <p>Most of the fishermen borrow money to buy or rent fishing nets. Since, the nets are very critical for their livelihood, they are usually charged high amounts by the money lenders and renters. Also, as it is a recurring expense on buying, renting and maintaining the nets, they get caught in a vicious circle of debt. Further, due to lack of financial literacy, the fisher-folk usually do not save for buying or mending of nets even though it is an integral part of their livelihood. Their income is just enough to make ends meet, so they are unable to afford the costs of replacing the nets. There was a real need for them to develop a habit of saving but that had to be preceded by having some extra income which will allow them to save.  </p>
        <p>To address this issue and enable the fishermen community to rise above these circumstances, Adani Foundation started providing them with a one-time financial aid up to Rs. 10,000/- for procuring equipment. The fishermen utilized the amount for procuring various kinds of fishing nets, ropes, boya and other equipment required for fish sorting and vending. Further, Adani Foundation’s investment in the fields of infrastructure like building sorting sheds and fitting solar lights has come as a boon for the community.  </p>
