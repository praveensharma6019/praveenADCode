        <p>Creating opportunities for rural communities is at the heart of creating shared prosperity and nation building. And the success of sustainable livelihood development at the grassroots cannot be achieved without pressing for gender equity and equality &ndash; as socio-economic independence of women is inextricably linked to the overall development of communities. Data from International Labour Organization (ILO) shows that around 1.3 billion people around the globe live in absolute poverty, of which, 70% are women. Deepening the concern, women account for just 10% of the world&rsquo;s income and own less than 1% of world&rsquo;s property.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In India, women dominate the micro enterprise sector both in rural and urban areas, however the sustainability of such units and their participation in small and medium enterprises is low.&nbsp; Even though the Government of India has taken various steps towards the welfare of the women in general and women-led enterprises in particular, the contribution of Indian women to the GDP is only 17%, whereas the global average is 37%. Sustainable business models to boost women-owned and women-led enterprises are therefore vital to overcome the existing challenges.</p>
