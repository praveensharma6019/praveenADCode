        <p class="pl-4 mb-3">Recognizing the government as the key player in the provision of basic infrastructure facilities, the Foundation endeavours to bridge the gaps and make its activities more need specific and responsive to the grassroots’ requirements. This includes facilitating education-related infrastructure projects helping thousands of children to learn in a conducive environment. </p>
        <p class="pl-4 mb-3 d-none">Adani Foundation believes that basic facilities when upgraded can raise standard of living of the villagers. It provides assistance in improving drinking water facilities and sanitation. It helps renovate school buildings, healthcare centres, and even homes. It has installed solar street lights and has supported in the construction of approach roads, pipe culverts, playground, market platforms, panchayat bhavans, religious places, etc. across the country.</p>
