        <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="background: white; letter-spacing: 0.6pt; color: black;"><strong>Any book that helps a child to form a habit of reading, to make reading one of his needs, is good for him&nbsp;&mdash; Maya Angelou</strong></span></em></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>When was the last time you saw your child pick up a book to read? When was the last time you sat with him to read a book together? Reading has taken a backseat for many of us, despite knowing its manifold effects on both physical and mental levels. Reading recharges your brain. It makes you rich in vocabulary and improves your cognitive functions because the more you read, the more mindful and curious you become. Reading is the foundation of learning, and children must be motivated to read books on their own. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>To encourage <span style="background: white; letter-spacing: 0.6pt; color: black;">young people to discover the pleasures of reading, and celebrate books and authors, UNESCO initiated the World Book and Copyright Day on 23 April 1995. That children become fond of letters, inculcating reading habit in them is essential. T</span></span><span style="background: white; letter-spacing: -0.25pt; color: black;">he National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasises on the importance of well-stocked school libraries and digital libraries to attain the goal of foundational literacy for all children by the year 2025. It recommends that quality literature should be made available to children in all local languages to build a culture of reading across the country.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background: white; letter-spacing: -0.25pt; color: black;"><strong>Developing reading corner</strong><br />
        Adani Foundation&rsquo;s Project Utthan focuses on progressive learners and at the same it emphasises on cultivating reading habit in all 100 adopted government primary schools across Gujarat. Around 1 lakh books and annual subscription of 7 magazines are being provided from 2018, when the project was initiated. These books are entirely child centric &ndash; with less words and more pictures. This helps them to develop critical and logical thinking. Around 12,000 students benefit from this initiative.</span></p>
