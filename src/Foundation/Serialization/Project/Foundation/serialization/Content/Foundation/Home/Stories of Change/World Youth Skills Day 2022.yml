        <p>Adani Skill Development Centre (ASDC) has been on a fascinating journey since its inception in 2016, and we have seen many obstacles. Not only because of pandemic but also because of different geographies, cultures, and the mentality of people. To balance it, we introduced transformational techniques for skill development training at ASDC. What gives us a real sense of pride and accomplishment is to see some successful training and livelihood models as the larger outcome of these training programmes.</p>
        <p>I am delighted to share that Adani Saksham recently achieved the milestone of training 1,00,000 youth in different courses, in 11 states across India. What is even more satisfying is that of these 1,00,000 youth &ndash; over 60% are women &ndash; of which about 67% have started generating livelihood from different sources. We have worked with many communities across the nation and in different domains &ndash; and many of these models on women empowerment. To name a few, we have Phoolo Jhano Saksham Aajeevika Sakhi Mandal in Jharkhand, Clean4U, You Me &amp; Tea Caf&eacute; and VizMart in Kerala and Kashi Prerana Saksham Producer Company in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
        <p>At Phoolo Jhano Saksham Aajeevika Sakhi Mandal, women were trained on the art of stitching followed by getting a huge order to stitch school uniforms for the Government Primary Schools in Jharkhand. Over 1,800 women received their first work order worth of ₹12,00,00,000 to stitch around 3,00,000 pairs of uniforms. This empowered women in establishing their own enterprise with confidence of generating more revenue to sustain their family in a better way.</p>
