      Hint: Summary
      Value: "For Adani Foundation, it didn’t stop there. Under an initiative to protect and preserve the coastal environment, mangrove nurseries were established and plantation projects were undertaken. In order to make the projects a resounding success, the local fisher-folks were involved during their off-fishing season. Yakub bhai was the one of those who could have the employment opportunity during their off-season. Upon experiencing the benefits, he also recommended the scheme to his fellow fisher-folks. "
