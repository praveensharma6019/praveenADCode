This content is available to viewers on a variety of online and broadcast platforms in several easy-to-access formats. A song, 'Yog Karo,' created by Sachin-Jigar and sung by Shankar Mahadevan, has also been produced to raise awareness, highlighting the beauty of Gujarat and depicting various yoga positions. The elements of each asana or posture performed in this song is linked to that particular site, such as the performance of Simhasana, Vrukshasana, and Mayurasana at Gir Forest.</p>
