      Hint: Description
      Value: |
        <p>In the poem, The Waste Land, poet TS Eliot describes wasteland as a place which is barren and infertile, having no vegetation &ndash; &ldquo;a wasteland where the sun is harsh and dead trees offer no shade, crickets no longer sing, and water does not run&rdquo;. Degradation of land has become modern times' curse. The government has realised the importance of reclaiming such land and turning it into a biodiversity park for environmental sustainability. Biodiversity parks play an important role in reducing air pollution, recharging ground water, and mitigating extreme weather conditions and climate change.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under Mukhyamantri Jal Svavlamban Abhiyan (MJSA), the government aims to approach different states to develop such parks in urban and rural areas. In one such effort, a biodiversity park at Kunjer village in Attru tehsil of Baran district has been developed near Kawai &ndash; a CSR site of Adani Foundation (AF). For a decade, AF has been running various projects related to education, SuPoshan, community health, sustainable livelihood, etc., in the villages near Kawai.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in April 2016, when the then district magistrate and collector (DM) Mr. S.P. Singh (IAS) called us (AF) for a meeting which was held with all the departmental heads of the district. One of the items on the agenda was to implement the MJSA. The DM urged the Foundation to be part of the Abhiyan in the district and take over a site to implement the project. The MJSA aims at making the village self-dependent by providing a permanent solution in terms of water requirements by involving communities, non-government organisations, corporate social responsibilities, funds from state and national governments, and others.</p>
        <p>AF selected Kunjer as it was already a project village, and the CSR team had a good rapport with the community. The CSR team met the then Sarpanch, Shri Prashant Patni, and other members of the gram panchayat and floated the idea of converting the panchayat&rsquo;s wasteland into a beautiful green landscape &mdash; a biodiversity park. The panchayat members concurred and decided to talk to the communities. However, the wasteland had been encroached upon. Those who had encroached the land were shown the maps, and efforts were made to recover it peacefully. A few let go of the land quietly, some reluctantly after repeated counselling, and others had to be dealt with strictly by the district administration.&nbsp;</p>
