        In these tough times, we did not limit ourselves to reaching out to the children in our own schools. Through &lsquo;Utthan&rsquo;, we have been mainstreaming more than 700 Priya (progressive) students of government primary schools, strengthening their reading, writing and numerical skills as well as igniting that mindset in them &ndash; yes we can and we will. The smiles and confidence that are spontaneously generated through Utthan Sahayaks (supplementary teachers) are truly resilient.&nbsp;<br />

        It was again during these difficult times, Adani Foundation conceived and created digital resources in self-learning module for Class 5 students, who are aspiring to seek admission in Class 6 in Javahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNV) and Sainik Schools. The course and test planners do facilitate streamlined implementation at all our sites &ndash; every Tuesday is an assessment day. Today 1,552 students hailing from 550+ schools are getting set for 2021 entrance examination.&nbsp;
