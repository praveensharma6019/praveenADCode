The &lsquo;Learn from Home&rsquo; Model of Gyanodaya is facilitating the continual learning to masses through DD Jharkhand (3 millions); Gyanodaya YouTube channel (8 millions) and Diksha portal &ndash; an initiative of the National Council of Educational Research and Training under the Ministry of Education, Government of India.&nbsp; Even here we care for those, who do not have access to the internet or smartphones.
