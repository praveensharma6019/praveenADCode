        As we were getting set to commence the physical classes from April 2021 with specific action plans on what students missed out during the last academic year &ndash; fundamental reading and math skills - the second wave of pandemic flipped almost every aspect of school once again. It created unprecedented impact again on all, especially on children. <span style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #212529;">In this phase of fear and uncertainties, Adani Foundation continues to be a catalyst in restoring education to many more with more passion and innovation through its CSR initiatives.&nbsp;</span>There is nothing more beautiful in this world than touching lives and empowering minds.&nbsp; Yes, that is the mission called &lsquo;education&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
