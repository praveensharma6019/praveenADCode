        <strong><em>Adapting to online classes</em></strong><br />
        <br />
        The Adani Foundation run Adani Vidya Mandirs at Ahmedabad, Bhadreshwar and Surguja abide by the vision of creating a &lsquo;A Place to Learn; A Space to Grow&rsquo; to those bright students, who are disadvantaged. Started in 2008 with 134 students in Ahmedabad, today more than 3000 students call Adani Vidya Mandir their &lsquo;Alma Mater&rsquo;. Despite being cost free, all the schools are either accredited or in the process of getting accredited by NABET under Quality Council of India (QCI). While the school in Ahmedabad caters to the marginalized sections of the society, the school in Bhadreshwar and Surguja cater to many first time learners from fisher-folk and tribal communities respectively.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        During this pandemic, our teachers have enthusiastically come out of their routines, reaching out to every child. Apart from teaching their assigned subjects, conducting online prayers, demonstrating experiments and sharing stories of resilience, they have been regularly connecting with every student &lsquo;as their own&rsquo; &ndash; giving them confidence, motivation and support &ndash; truly as influencers and mentors. Those students, who could not participate in the online classes due to their challenging situations, were not left out. In Bhadreshwar and Surguja, AVM teachers have been personally visiting their homes enquiring their well-being and fulfilling the learning requirements &ndash; providing self-learning modules (SLMs) on a weekly basis since April 2020. This personal touch makes our intervention stand apart.
