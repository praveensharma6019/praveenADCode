        With financial support from AF, I could not only come out of the debt trap, but the Janashree Bima Yojana also covered me from further risks. My sons were also facilitated to continue their studies in high school.

        <p>Proper homes have been built for all fishermen families and drinking water provision is also made. A mobile healthcare unit visits the community on a regular basis through which doctor consultation, free medicines and optimum medical care are ensured. A concrete road has been constructed for ease of accessibility. Earlier, only 30-40% children in the community would enroll in and receive formal education. Today, the number has increased to 80-85%. By providing 100% scholarship to girls and 80% to boys, parents are encouraged to send their children to school in the hope of their bright future. The balwadis and the Adani Vidya Mandir in Bhadreshwar are a blessing for their children, securing educational opportunities. </p>
        <p>As is the case with all fisher-folk, Yakub is usually self-employed for a period of 7-8 months during which he resides in the coastal settlements of the fishing community. For the rest of the year, when he is unemployed, he returns to his village. With Adani’s investments in Mundra, the communities can now look for opportunities beyond fishing. Under an initiative to protect and preserve the coastal environment, mangrove nurseries were established and plantation projects were undertaken. In order to make the projects a resounding success, the local fisher-folks were involved during their off-fishing season. </p>
        <p>Thus, the continued direct and indirect support to the fishermen for their livelihoods and their families has improved the community’s overall standard of living. With young members of the family enrolled in formal education, they are hopeful of a promising future.</p>
