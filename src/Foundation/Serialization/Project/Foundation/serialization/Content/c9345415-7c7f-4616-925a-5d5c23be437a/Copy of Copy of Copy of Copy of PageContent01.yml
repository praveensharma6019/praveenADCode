      Value: "<p>Then came the National Nutrition Month or Poshan Maah which is celebrated in September each year under the aegis of the Government of India&rsquo;s Poshan Abhiyaan to drive community mobilization and ownership. During the month, SuPoshan Sanginis conducted family counselling on &lsquo;feeding smart, right from the start&rsquo;. They promoted local foods which are affordable and easily available to be incorporated in the form of a rainbow diet &ndash; ensuring enough nutrients from plant-based foods in a wide array of colors for &lsquo;more variation, more nutrition&rsquo;. They initiated plantation drives at household where Severely Acute Malnourished (SAM) children, pregnant women and adolescent girls reside. If the household didn&rsquo;t have enough space for the same, families were encouraged to grow tri-color vegetables and fruits in either waste containers or earthen pots. Further, in the wake of the pandemic, the importance for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) was reaffirmed by promoting frequent handwashing practices. The ceaseless efforts on ground helped us to reach more than 50,000 beneficiaries throughout the month.</p>"
