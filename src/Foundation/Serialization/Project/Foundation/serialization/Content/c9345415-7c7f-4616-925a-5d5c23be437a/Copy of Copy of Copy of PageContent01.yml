        <p>Adani Foundation&rsquo;s SuPoshan project aims to attain maximum sustainability by training community resources (SuPoshan Sanginis) who prompt organic, behavioural change at household level. Their contribution and proactive nature of work is recognized by many stakeholders at the village level. For instance, in Narmada district&rsquo;s Garudeshwar block (Gujarat), 29 Sanginis received certificates of appreciation during Poshan Maah in the village Gram Sabha, in the presence of Sarpanch and Talati. In another instance, 23 SuPoshan Sanginis in Bundi district (Rajasthan), were invited by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), to train them further in the subject of Poshan Vatika (kitchen garden). Adani Foundation also received a letter of appreciation for the work being implemented in Bundi.&nbsp;<br />
        While all energies converge in the Poshan Maah, healthy nutrition practices should be implemented every single day. Our teams are determined to bounce back and enhance the nutrition status at village level &ndash; covering more than 1,026 villages and 139 urban slums in 10 Indian states &ndash; helping the nation stay on track to achieve zero hunger by 2030.&nbsp;</p>
