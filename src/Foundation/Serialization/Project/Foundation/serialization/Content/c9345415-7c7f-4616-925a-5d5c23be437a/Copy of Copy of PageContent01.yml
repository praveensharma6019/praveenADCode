      Value: <p>Field activities at community level were reinitiated from July 2021 through a series of activities like child anthropometry, family counselling, focused group discussions, cooking demonstrations and sustainable food sourcing by promoting kitchen gardens. Anchoring these comprehensive efforts were SuPoshan project officers, aiming to raise awareness about preventing malnutrition right from the start, rather than treating it later. In this context, the project teams observed World Breastfeeding Week from August 1 to 7 across all sites and reached more than 17,000 beneficiaries. A series of innovative activities such as family counselling to &lsquo;Protect Breastfeeding &ndash; A Shared Responsibility&rsquo; were conducted &ndash; where not only mothers but fathers and other family members/caregivers were engaged. Demonstrations on proper breastfeeding techniques, cooking recipes which improves lactation and help to increase breastmilk production, mass awareness through wall writing, poster making, slogan and rangoli competition were also held.</p>
