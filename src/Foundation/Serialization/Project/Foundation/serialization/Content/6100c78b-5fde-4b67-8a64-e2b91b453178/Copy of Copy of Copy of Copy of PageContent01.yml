        <p>Recently, 8 young women received employment with a global medical equipment maker for their first manufacturing facility in India, which is set up in Mundra, Gujarat. This was possible due to coordination efforts of Adani Foundation team, keeping in mind the industry requirements. The manufacturer provides reliable cold chain solutions which are very integral in these times for preserving the potency of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
        <p>Moreover, project Fortune SuPoshan&rsquo;s network has been critical in relaying the correct information amidst community members. Its workforce, which comprises more than 600 young community women who are trained to become SuPoshan Sanginis, have become trustworthy guides when it comes to matters related to hygiene, masking up, food and nutrition security, vaccination etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Ensuring Continuity of Education&nbsp;</strong><br />
        When schools across the country switched to online classes, a large part of the underprivileged population was left out. However, more than 65 young Utthan Sahayaks ensured that education reaches 700 Priya vidyarthis (progressive learners) in villages of Mundra and Hazira through regular home visits. Utthan Sahayaks are supplementary teachers who contribute to mainstreaming the government primary school students, strengthening their reading, writing and numerical skills.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
