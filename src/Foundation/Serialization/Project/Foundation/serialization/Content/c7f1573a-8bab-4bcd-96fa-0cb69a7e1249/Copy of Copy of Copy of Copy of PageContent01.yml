        <p>More specifically, women centric micro-enterprise development at Vizhinjam (Kerala) is an emerging saga that started with low capital and low risk at the initial stage, gaining momentum with advanced resources and technology while becoming matured units.&nbsp; This livelihood model has provided an alternate income to 250 poor families in Vizhinjam. Each member is earning an amount ranging between INR 72,000 and INR 1,50,000 per annum. In this journey, the initial task was to identify and conduct capacity-building of potential entrepreneurs. Basic livelihood management training was provided to 1,200 women from fishing communities and other marginalized sections in and around Vizhinjam.&nbsp; This includes classroom sessions and practical exercises on market study, feasibility test and project preparation to get a clear understanding on the risks and challenges of business.&nbsp; The training helped to identify 250 women who were both interested as well as capable to start group enterprises.</p>
        <p>These enterprises are developed by ensuring that 50% of the project cost borne by the women&rsquo;s groups, which is another way to crystalize the intent and genuineness of the stakeholders.&nbsp; Presently at Vizhinjam, 17 such innovative livelihood projects having 5-10 women in each group are running successfully. This includes a high-tech cleaning unit, high-tech poultry units, Eco-shop unit, Event management unit etc. Most of these units are housed at a common shop called VIZMART, managed by a federated committee of all the livelihood units. This setting up of a market platform has proved to be a major and effective way to support the groups. A bankers&rsquo; platform has also been created, the impact of which is evident in 100% fulfilment of EMI by all groups, wherein some of the groups have even closed the loan well in advance and have taken a second loan for expansion purposes.</p>
        <p>The cleaning unit mentioned above is called Clean 4 U, run by a group of five women from low-income families in Vizhinjam, providing cleaning services to hospitals, homes, offices etc. The group started with twelve clients in the first three months which has now been expanded to 61 clients. What is noteworthy is that currently, the unit employs 25 women. The group has purchased their own four-wheeler, cleared all bank loans and each member is taking an average of INR 10,000 per month as salary from the total earnings. Despite the initial struggle to overcome the societal norms, they are now highly recognized and appreciated by their family and community members.</p>
        <p>The importance of economic growth of women goes beyond the direct benefits of eradication of poverty (SDG 1) and zero hunger (SDG 2), and indirectly brings improvements in health (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5). Our investment in developing capabilities and investment capacity of women by providing technical know-how and requisite financial products is indispensable to facilitate inclusive growth and transformation in the new, real, rural India.&nbsp;</p>
