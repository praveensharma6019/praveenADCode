        <p>The cleaning unit mentioned above is called Clean 4 U, run by a group of five women from low-income families in Vizhinjam, providing cleaning services to hospitals, homes, offices etc. The group started with twelve clients in the first three months which has now been expanded to 61 clients. What is noteworthy is that currently, the unit employs 25 women. The group has purchased their own four-wheeler, cleared all bank loans and each member is taking an average of INR 10,000 per month as salary from the total earnings. Despite the initial struggle to overcome the societal norms, they are now highly recognized and appreciated by their family and community members.</p>
        <p>The importance of economic growth of women goes beyond the direct benefits of eradication of poverty (SDG 1) and zero hunger (SDG 2), and indirectly brings improvements in health (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5). Our investment in developing capabilities and investment capacity of women by providing technical know-how and requisite financial products is indispensable to facilitate inclusive growth and transformation in the new, real, rural India.&nbsp;</p>
