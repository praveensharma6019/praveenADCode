        <p>Adani Foundation, the CSR arm of Adani Group, equips communities by undertaking systematic capacity building exercises and extending handholding support.&nbsp; This has paid impetus to women-owned units in preparing bankable projects, mobilizing resources, connecting financial institutions, exploring market linkages, ensuring proper branding, and providing highest quality in services and products. This is done in alignment with the sustainable livelihood approaches of organizations like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), CARE, and the Department for International Development (DFID).</p>
        <p>Over the last five years, Adani Foundation&rsquo;s initiatives to boost women-owned enterprises and self-help groups (SHGs) have reached greater heights, covering more than 20,000 community members in farming and non-farming sectors.&nbsp; A few success stories include the Phoolo Jhano Saksham Ajeevika Sakhi Mandal (PJSASM) at Godda (Jharkhand) which engages 1500 women through stitching and garments making units, Mahila Udyami Bahuddeshiya Sahkari Samiti Ltd (MUBSS) at Surguja (Chhattisgarh) which is a tribal women led federation of 49 SHGs with 250 women shareholder members, and the Pragatishil Mahila Farmers Producer Company (PMFPC) at Tirora (Maharashtra) with 238 stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
