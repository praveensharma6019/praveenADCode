        <p>As per the international norms, a country is classified as water stressed and water scarce if per capita water availability goes below 1700 M3 and 1000 M3 respectively. With 1544 M3 per capita water availability, India is already a water-stressed country and is moving towards turning into water scarce. Groundwater lowering occurs when it is withdrawn faster than it is recharged. This may eventually lead to drying of wells and ground subsidence.</p>
        <p>To attain sustainable development in the agriculture-based country, the Adani Foundation initiated water conservation projects across India, mainly in six states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. Steady depletion of groundwater and frequent drought make it imperative for the Foundation and society to work systematically for water conservation. </p>
        <p>Water crisis and drought are not new to Kutch. Rambhai Gadhvi of Zarpara has seen and lived the difficulties caused by famine-like situations in the region. He remembers how as a small child he would wake up early in the morning and travel long distances with his elders to fetch water. It left such an impact on him that he began searching for a solution to this perennial problem and found it in water conservation. Under the guidance of the Foundation, he practised non-irrigation agricultural methods to fight the water crisis. He recharged his borewell and established farm bunding to increase the level of groundwater during rains and prevent water run-off. </p>
        <p>Not only did he manage to tackle water crisis, but he also guided other farmers to adopt water conservation practices. He and his wife Veerbai’s enthusiasm in micro irrigation, fodder cultivation, and recharge activities is remarkable. They are the real change makers, who have benefitted from the Foundation’s sustainable agriculture projects.    </p>
