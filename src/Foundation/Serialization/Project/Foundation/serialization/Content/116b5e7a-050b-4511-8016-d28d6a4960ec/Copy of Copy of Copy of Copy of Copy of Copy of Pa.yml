        <p>The Foundation has carried out projects like construction of check dam, deepening of pond and recharging of dead wells and borewells with rainwater to bring up the groundwater table and reduce TDS in water. To recharge borewells and wells, recharge pit is constructed to accumulate the storm water flowing from the natural drain covering the farm. By doing this, the saline water is replaced by fresh water. This helps farmers to grow crops across the year and help in crop rotation. They can now cultivate variety of crops and fodder throughout the year.</p>
        <p>Till now, 21 check dams have been constructed, 365 ponds/streams deepened, and 132 borewells and 57 wells recharged. This has helped to increase 78.71 MCM water storage capacity and benefitted 18,828 acres of agriculture land and 19,058 farmers.</p>
