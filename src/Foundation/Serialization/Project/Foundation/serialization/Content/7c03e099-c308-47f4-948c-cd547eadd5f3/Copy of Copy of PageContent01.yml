        <p><strong><em>Mamdsakil Manjaliya with AVMB Principal Lally Sukumaran</em></strong></p>
        <p>It was no surprise then, that he secured admission to pursue a diploma in Mechanical Engineering in Government Polytechnic College, Bhuj; Adani Foundation sponsored his fees. In July 2021, Mamadsakil became the first engineer in Luni&rsquo;s fisherfolk community. Another big moment of pride came in the Manjaliya family when Mamadsakil received an offer of employment with the Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) Ltd in Mundra.&nbsp;</p>
