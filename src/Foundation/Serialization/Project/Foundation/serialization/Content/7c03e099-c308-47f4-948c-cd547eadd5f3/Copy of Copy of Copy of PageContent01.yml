        <p><strong><em>Mamadsakil receiving his offer letter from Rakshit Shah, Executive Director, APSEZ Ltd.</em></strong></p>
        <p>Mamadsakil&rsquo;s journey underlines the importance of educational opportunities in rural communities to reduce poverty and inequality. Many children from remote villages are first-generation learners like Mamadsakil. The success of students like him is a real victory for AVMB &ndash; a school that is working tirelessly to facilitate quality education for the fisherfolk community, in and around Bhadreshwar. Now, Mamadsakil&rsquo;s younger brother and a sister are also studying in AVMB &ndash; the school has a policy of admitting two children per fisherfolk family. There is a hope for a better future for the Manjaliya family, and many more such families wherein underserved children receive their &lsquo;Right to Education&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adani Foundation, the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) arm of the Adani Group is steadfast in its mission to promote education for sustainable development.</p>
