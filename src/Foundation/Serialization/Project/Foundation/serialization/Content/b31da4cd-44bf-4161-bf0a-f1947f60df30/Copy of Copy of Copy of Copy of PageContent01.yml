      Hint: Summary
      Value: <p>During my interactions with the fisherfolk community, one of the most overwhelming things that I found was that regardless of occupation or age, each member of the community held great knowledge of the mangrove. The tangled roots of mangroves provide a unique habitat for various marine species, including the mud crab which enables them with an additional source of livelihood, while becoming barriers for cyclone and soil erosion. The forests support coastal biodiversity to thrive by providing shelter to a wide range of reptiles, birds, and mammals. It is evident that the mangrove forests are an integral part of the lives and livelihood of thousands of communities which rely on them. Hence, they are the best people to manage them.&nbsp;</p>
