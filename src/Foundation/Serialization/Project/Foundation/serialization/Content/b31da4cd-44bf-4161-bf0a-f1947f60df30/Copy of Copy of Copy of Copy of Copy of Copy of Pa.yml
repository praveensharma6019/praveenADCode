        <p>As efforts by researchers and governments intensified for mangrove restoration and conservation, Adani Foundation is carrying out the large-scale mangrove plantation and development project at Mundra in the Kutch region of Gujarat. It was in the year 2011 that the Adani Foundation team visited Luni Hamrira costal belt which was occupied with lightly grown mangroves in a scattered manner, despite being a good intertidal zone. Our goal was clear &ndash; to convert it into dense mangrove forest. Several initial meetings were organized for project planning and implementation and finally it was decided to start nursery development of Avicania Marine, a local species of mangrove. We involved the fisherfolk community in their off-season. The nursery development, plantation and maintenance would provide them an alternative livelihood.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the first year, the survival rate was lower, but soon with optimal training and experience, the fisherfolk brought up the survival rate to 90%. After 12 years of rigorous effort, an area of approximately 160 hectares at Luni coast is now a dense mangrove forest. During this time, we also envisioned and implemented a multi-species Mangrove Biodiversity Park in an area of 12 hectares (at present) which would extend up to 25 hectares in collaboration with the Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology (GUIDE), Bhuj, Kutch in due course of time. This Park will become a knowledge centre on the mangrove ecosystem and simultaneously conserve the species of Avicenna Marina, Rhizophora Mucronata, Ceriops Tagal, and Ceropos decandra.</p>
