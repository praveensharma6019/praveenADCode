        <p>Another initiative to augment environmental biodiversity that I have seen take shape is the Smriti Van Memorial Park &ndash; a unique idea of Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi to commemorate the death of 13,805 people who lost their lives to the massive earthquake which shook Bhuj in 2001. 20 years later, the earthquake still evoke fear and an irreparable sense of loss &ndash; so in 2021, the Smritivan project was born to honour the lives lost in the past by nurturing the Mother Earth with a variety of species, creating a green belt for the future generations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Smriti Van memorial will occupy 406 acres of space of the Bhujia Dungar near Bhuj; Part of it is a museum, Convention Centre, Sunset Point and Ecological Park. For the ecological park, many stakeholders have come forward to share responsibility to develop the 24 acres land that has been demarcated to plant 3 lakh trees of local species. Under Phase &ndash; 1, the Govt of Gujarat through GSDMA will be planting 1 lakh trees across 15 acres through Miyawaki methodology &ndash; a strategic tree plantation technique that results in dense forestation. In this methodology, two to four trees are planted per square meter. Miyawaki forests grow in two to three years and are self-sustaining. They help lower temperatures, reduce air and noise pollution, attract local birds and insects, and create carbon sinks.</p>
