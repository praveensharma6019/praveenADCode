        <p>Adani Foundation has supported the development of 3 acre land in which 90+ species of trees have been planted. The scope of work includes development of the nursery, soil enrichment, plantation of saplings, mulching, biomass application, water supply, and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Theory is one thing and witnessing the progress is another. I can see how fast the forest is growing, and we are already enjoying its benefits. Cool breeze, shade of trees, and clean air, soil &amp; water should be a reality for our future generations. Supporting restoration of the environment through community engagement and partnership model is at the heart of Adani Foundation&rsquo;s CSR efforts &ndash; while the Mangrove Biodiversity Park and Smriti Van Memorial Park are flourishing, other works are being initiated for enrichment and enhancement of biodiversity spots.&nbsp;</p>
