      Hint: Summary
      Value: |
        <p>We need to look at these models in the context of the high unemployment ratio in the country, particularly in the women workforce. As per the World Economic Forum;s recently released Global Gender Gap Index 2022, India ranks 135 among a total of 146 countries. We have a long, long way to go to reach gender parity. In the above mentioned SAKSHAM models, women belong to low-income, male-dominated households. This shows how important skill development can be to make women employable and provide them livelihood opportunities. This ultimately helps break the cycle of poverty and pave the way towards a more just and equal future.</p>
        <p>I will conclude by mentioning one of our major focus areas of bringing latest and state-of-the-art technologies. While the above examples highlight women&rsquo;s progress, the courses which are highly popular amongst the 40% male candidates include technical courses like welding, electrician and crane operation etc. In these, ASDC has adopted and developed state-of-the-art simulators using AR &amp; VR technologies to bring in highest level of efficiency. They offer an unmatched experience for the learners, who gain both skills and confidence. I wish that we celebrate more milestones soon, enabling people to take up employment opportunities or become self-employed, because each trainee who we assist through skill development will contribute to our nation&rsquo;s prosperity and ensure growth with goodness.</p>
