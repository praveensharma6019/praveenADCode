        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The schools run by Adani Foundation, such as the Adani Vidya Mandirs, were quick to make the switch to formal, systematic online learning modules. It was the students at the margins, such as the ones those are catered to by projects like Utthan and Gyanodaya, who were at the risk of being left out from the purview of quality education. The course that these two distinct educational initiatives have taken, illustrates that far beyond the digital urban-rural divide in India, a customized approach is the need of the hour to ensure that education continues for as many students as possible. One that is based on demographics like socio-economic conditions, the overall literacy rate, availability of resources etc.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>To balance health risks associated with in-person learning against the educational needs of children, which may be better served when kids are in their physical schools, is a tricky path which educationists are trying to navigate. We are only scratching the surface in battling the short-term and long-term academic impacts of COVID-19. Through continuous performance assessment of our schools and projects in the coming months, by way of examining students&rsquo; academic progress, we will persevere to recover and grow. We remain committed to the cause of sustainable development by fine tuning CSR initiatives of Adani Foundation.</span></p>
