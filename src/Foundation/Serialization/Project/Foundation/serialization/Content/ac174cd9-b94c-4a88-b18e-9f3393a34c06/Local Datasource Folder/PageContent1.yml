        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;And so, the mission continues, in which 35 Utthan Sahayaks like Hasbai have been visiting the children to teach them, armed with proper precautions. This covers 35 government schools of Mundra, Nakhatrana and Hazira, located across 24 villages in Gujarat. As a result, more than 700 beneficiary students engaged in online classes, before in-person learning became safe and possible. In fact, more than 600 children, who do not belong to schools adopted under Utthan project but live in nearby areas, are also attending these home-based lessons now.&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Until July 2020, classes were conducted through whatsapp video calls &ndash; the easiest and most-widely available method of reaching students whose family members had a phone to spare. A switch was then made to google meets, and yet the parents felt that the children were close to losing out on the progress made so far, until the home-based learning model came to the rescue.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Let me share another example. This one is from the district of Godda, located at the far end of Jharkhand &ndash; a state in east India. In this aspirational district, a different strategy took off. The Gyanodaya project which is being run there by the Foundation in partnership with the district administration and Eckovation Pvt. Ltd., was already delivering digital education to remotest areas of the district in smart classrooms of government schools. It covered 246 govt. schools, reaching more than 50,000 students studying in classes 6th to 12th.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, the government decided to air the Gyanodaya syllabus on Doordarshan Jharkhand starting 11th May, 2020, with the potential to benefit more than 50 lakh students across the state. Later, as the lockdown was relaxed, five Gyanodaya Raths were flagged off by the government, equipped with the digital curriculum which would reach small groups of students in the district who did not have access to smart devices.</span></p>
