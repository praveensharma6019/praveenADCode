        <p>Around 200 bighas of wasteland became available to the gram panchayat for this intervention. AF and the gram panchayat with the support of government officials signed an MoU, which stated that AF would contribute towards land improvement, fencing, water conservation structure, watch tower and other miscellaneous construction works whereas the gram panchayat would take care of operations and maintenance, including regular weed removal, grass cutting, tree pruning and other works like managing human and capital resources.</p>
        <p>AF removed unwanted invasive shrubs (prosopis juliflora) and dug up a 2.5-km-long trench having a 1 m width and a 1 m depth. A barbed wire fence with a 6 ft height was installed on its edges to protect the land from cattle and illegal human trespassing. The trench also helps with water infiltration. A water drainage passing through this land was desilted up to 500m and an anicut was constructed to make water available for the wild animals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. These interventions remarkably increased the ground water table, prevented soil erosion, enhanced the soil moisture of the land, and helped with vegetation improvement.</p>
