        <p>Jyoti saw a ray of hope when she found out about the opportunity to enroll in a course to become a General Duty Assistant. It was being conducted under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) at Adani Skill Development Centre (ASDC), Bhuj. She visited the centre and inquired about the course and employment opportunities. Her long lost ambitions and hope were re-ignited. </p>
        <p>Jyoti shares “The training I underwent was one of the best experiences of my life. I felt like I was reliving my school days which I had cherished a lot. I used to write notes in every class and was the most excited student during practical sessions. I would dedicatedly study at home to remember the names of all the equipment and revise the treatment procedures.”  After classroom training, Jyoti and her batch mates underwent a month long on the job training (OJT) at GAIMS, Bhuj hospital. She adds that it was during this OJT that her personality was transformed. The interactions with nurses, doctors and patients boosted her confidence.</p>
