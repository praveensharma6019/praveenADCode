        <p>Jyoti excelled in the impending PMKVY assessment and secured a job as Patient Care Assistant at GAIMS. With a monthly salary of INR 10,000, she is able to pay her children’s school fees and is slowly but steadily managing her savings for the future of her family. As someone who is well-versed with the hospital environment after gaining one-year work experience, her skills have been particularly appreciated amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. She is spreading awareness about preventive measures while discharging her duties fearlessly.  </p>
        <p>Her training at the ASDC gave her an edge in not only getting gainful and meaningful employment but also in facing difficult situations at work. With utmost devotion and confidence, many people like Jyoti who have joined GAIMS after training at ASDC, Bhuj have been employed there for years. </p>
        <p>There is no greater testament to the power of skill-based training, than seeing families such as that of Jyoti’s, living a happy, stable and peaceful life. .</p>
