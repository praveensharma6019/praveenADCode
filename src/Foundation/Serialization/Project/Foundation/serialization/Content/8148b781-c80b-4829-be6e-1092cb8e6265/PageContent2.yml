        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>After a series of meetings with tribal families in different villages of the Dahanu block, we managed to convince 220 families to join hands with us. With time came small successes, and with came trust. More people came under the fold of the project – 650 families in second year and 350 families in third year. These were the families who had around 1 acre of farmland. But in our surveys, we found that there are landless families as well who could thrive with some support. We identified 100 such landless families and started working with them.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>A detailed survey of the selected villages and families was conducted by BAIF for identification of micro level activities for integrated development including water, health, infrastructure, education, women empowerment, and community involvement along with agriculture-based livelihood promotion.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The date from the from the survey reflected that agriculture was the major occupation and there was no secondary occupation for earning extra income. Only paddy was grown in the fields and that too for domestic use only and once the paddy season was over famers migrated to other places in search of labour work. The tribal farmers did not possess the 7/12 extract of their landholding due to which they were not able to receive benefits under government schemes. Health was a topic of serious concern as low agriculture production led to uncertainty in food security, resulting in poor health. Malnutrition, especially amongst women and children, were also common which contributed to maternal mortality and babies with low birth weight.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>I remember that in all our initial meetings and discussions the tribals showed a lot of willingness to adopt new methods of agriculture and were excited about the prospects of multi-cropping. Hence, when we designed the project, the focus was on improving the quality of life with consideration to the environment, available natural resources, traditional skills, and tribal culture. A diversified horti-forestry and agriculture program was worked out and hence titled as Wadi program – including horticulture, forestry, vegetable cultivation and floriculture. It is designed to the needs of the tribal families to enable them to earn a sustained income.</span></p>
