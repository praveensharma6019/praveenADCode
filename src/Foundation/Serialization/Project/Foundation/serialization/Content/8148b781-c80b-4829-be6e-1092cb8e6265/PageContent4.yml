        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The project is bearing fruits now – the families in the region are no longer dependent on just one, sparse source of income. They are now adopting horticulture, floriculture, and vegetable cultivation to augment their earnings. Through vegetable cultivation families are now earning INR 18,000-34,000 per year. 702 families cultivated Jasmine and earned an annual income in the range of INR 19000-45000. With enhanced and regular income, migration in the Dahanu block has reduced by up to 90%. This, I feel, is the true achievement.</span></p>
