        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>I have worked in the space of community development for my entire professional life, a large part of it has involved working with tribal communities in Maharashtra. I joined Adani Dahanu Thermal Power Station (ADTPS) in the early 1990’s and since then I’ve been actively involved in assignments that benefit the living standards of tribal people. In the year 2015, the efforts took shape of Wadi Project – an <strong>integrated tribal development project </strong> in Dahanu block of Palghar district and I was fortunate to become a part of the task force from day one.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The main objective of this comprehensive project is to create opportunities for gainful self-employment for the tribal families. This was done with financial support from the Adani Foundation and NABARD (Pune), implemented by BAIF Institute for Sustainable livelihood development. The major challenges that tribal families face which I’ve noted during my time in the region are low land holding, soil degradation, high agriculture input costs, problems of pests and diseases, limited credit availability and unfavourable market situations. All these factors put together made the farming here less profitable. As a result, migration was a major trend as 78.7 % families migrated for either brick making or sand dredging work.</span></p>
