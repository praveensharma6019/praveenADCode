        <p class="mb-3">The fishermen community is the largest group of beneficiaries of our initiatives in Mundra and Dhamra. In Mundra, the Foundation has assisted in providing good roads to reach sea shore settlements, platforms for drinking water, solar light, space for drying fish, appropriate shelters for the fisher-folk. In Dhamra’s fishing harbour, a solar fish dryer has been installed to be used by over 100 fishermen regularly. It has proven beneficial for the fishermen for drying up their fish in less time and in a hygienic manner.</p>
