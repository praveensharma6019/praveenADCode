        <p class="mb-3">Safe and clean sources of drinking water, combined with access to qualitative primary healthcare, lead to better productivity and reduction in morbidity. The Adani Foundation has implemented drinking water projects and construction of water harvesting structures across the country to store not just surface water but to also recharge the ground water. </p>
