        <h3>Adani Ahmedabad Marathon - #Run4OurSoldiers</h3>
        <p>The Adani Ahmedabad Marathon, an initiative by the Adani Group, is an expression of solidarity towards the bravehearts of India’s Armed Forces.</p>
        
        <p>The Ahmedabad Marathon took its inaugural stride in November 2017 and completed its fifth lap in November 2021. It has earned runners’ affection for offering one of the most picturesque routes in the world. The race categories include full marathon, half marathon, 10 km, and 5 km run.</p>
        
        <p>These races, which attracted nearly 20,000 participants in the first two editions, saw over 17,000 participants in the third and fourth editions. Post-Covid, the Ahmedabad Marathon was the first to organise a physical event by devising time-slot based systems that permitted over 8,000 runners to participate in the 2021 event over two days while adhering to Covid guidelines. </p>
        
        <p>In 2022, the Ahmedabad Marathon made it to the ‘Global Marathon Event List - AIMS World Running’, Ahmedabad’s only run to be featured on this global list.  </p>
        
        <p>The Ahmedabad Marathon’s cause, "# Run4OurSoldiers," is its distinguishing feature. It presents a unique opportunity for participants to pay tribute to our soldiers. More than 1,000 defence personnel (Air Force, Army and Navy) participate in the run annually. A major portion of the proceeds goes to the welfare of the Indian Armed Forces. </p>
