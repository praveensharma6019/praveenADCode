        <p>Gujarat Giants is a boxing franchise belonging to a new entity privately-owned by the founders of Adani Group, the diversified business conglomerate in India worth revenues of USD 13 Bn. The new company was created with an overarching philosophy to inculcate a culture of sports at the grassroots level and create globally competitive opportunities for future champions.</p>
        
        <p>Aligned with the Adani Group’s philosophy of nation-building, the multi-pronged approach has three broad 
        dimensions. This includes nurturing a shortlisted group of senior and junior athletes under our long-term sportsperson development programme, Garv Hai, strategic investments in franchise leagues that help bolster visibility and popularity of sports with limited reach in India and create state-of-the-art sports infrastructure in the country which serves as a platform to nurture gen-next global sports icons.
