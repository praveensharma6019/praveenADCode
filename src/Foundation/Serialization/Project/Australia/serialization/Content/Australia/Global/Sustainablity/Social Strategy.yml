        				<p>Adani Australia is committed to making a positive contribution
        to the communities in which it operates. We recognise the
        mutual benefits that come when we boost and include our local
        communities.</p>
        				<p class="pb-3">We have many local partnerships across North Queensland and
        Central Queensland, the locations of our Carmichael Mine and
        Rail projects and the Rugby Run solar farm.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-3">Together with the local community, we support the North
        Queensland Cowboys rugby league team as a Major Partner
        and are proud to be the presenting partner of its school attendance initiative, Adopt-A-School.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">For communities in Queensland and South Australia, Adani
        Australia thermal coal and renewable projects are underway.
        Through this we are creating jobs and opportunities, and
        helping to fund major infrastructure upgrades to hospitals, schools and roads by contributing billions of dollars in taxes and
        royalties.</p>
