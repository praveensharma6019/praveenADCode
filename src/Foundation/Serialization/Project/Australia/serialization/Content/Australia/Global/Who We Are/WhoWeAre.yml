        Adani Australia is a multi-dimensional energy and infrastructure company, dedicated to delivering energy solutions for an advancing world.
        By providing energy solutions here in Australia and the Asia Pacific region from thermal and renewable energy, we will create jobs and help fund major infrastructure upgrades to hospitals, schools and roads by contributing billions of dollars in taxes and royalties.
        Adani Australia owns and operates Abbot Point Terminal which has been exporting Queensland coal responsibly for 30 years.
        It is Australia&rsquo;s most northerly coal port and is located 25 kilometres north-west of Bowen, in North Queensland. The port is a modern, high volume, fast turnaround port complex with natural deep water, and is a multi-user port facility that currently has capacity to throughput up to 50Mtpa.
        Adani Renewables Australia will switch on its first solar farm at Rugby Run near Moranbah in late 2018. Rugby Run Solar Farm will supply 65MW of renewable power in phase 1, with the capacity to expand up to 170MW. A power purchase agreement has been signed to sell 80% of the energy generated. More than 247,000 solar panels will be installed, which will generate 185,000MWh of power each year from stage one. Adani Renewables Australia is also currently in commercial negotiations for its second solar farm in Whyalla.
        The Carmichael Project is a 10mtpa coal mine and 388km rail line that will generate billions of dollars in mining taxes and royalties, contributing to building schools, hospitals and roads for Queensland.Welcome to the new age of sustainable global energy.
        For Adani Australia, it all starts in Queensland.
