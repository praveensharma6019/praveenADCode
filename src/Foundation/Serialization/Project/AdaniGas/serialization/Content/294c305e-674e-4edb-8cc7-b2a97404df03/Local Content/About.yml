        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Pranav Adani, Managing Director, Agro, Oil and Gas, Adani Group </strong>stated, &ldquo;Government of India has set itself a target to increase the share of natural gas in India&rsquo;s primary energy mix to 15% till 2022 from the 6.5% in 2015. Given the pressing need for energy security in the country, natural gas is set to play a critical role in India&rsquo;s energy strategy. With authorization to develop gas infrastructure and distribute natural gas in 13 new geographic areas in AGL and 9 GAs in IOAGPL, we continue to be at the forefront of the Indian natural gas story.
