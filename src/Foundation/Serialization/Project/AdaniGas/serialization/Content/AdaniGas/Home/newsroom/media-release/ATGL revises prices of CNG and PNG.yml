        ATGL revises prices of CNG &amp; PNG

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Adani Total Gas welcomes the continued support of the Union Ministry of Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas to city gas distribution companies by way of the recent decision to increase the allocation of domestic gas and revise downward the Unified Base Price (UBP) applicable for CNG and Home PNG. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">While market-linked imported RLNG has been witnessing volatile and significantly higher international prices, ATGL didn&rsquo;t pass-through full increase in the price of RLNG or UBP to take care of consumer interest. The recent intervention by the Government of India has helped the CGD industry to moderate down the prices of CNG and Home PNG to the end consumers. Adani Total Gas, in line with its stated policy of taking care of consumer interest, has immediately reversed the increase effected in the prices and reduced the price for domestic PNG by up to Rs 3.20 per SCM and that of CNG by up to Rs 4.7 per kg. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The reduction in gas prices has been effected from 17 August 2022 across 19 geographical areas covered by ATGL, which will result in considerable savings for the lakhs of consumers we serve.</p>
