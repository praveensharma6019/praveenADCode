        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>The recent unfortunate COVID 19 event and the consequential nationwide lockdown in India has impacted the current ongoing demand of CNG and PNG by industrial and commercial segments. City Gas distribution falls under essential services and Adani Gas Limited will ensure that during this period of crisis, supply of PNG and CNG is maintained without any interruption together with 24X7 provision of operation and emergency services and enhanced digital services to our consumers.</span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Currently, with over 95% of volume coming from the operational GAs, makes the business quite resilient. We expect to continue to generate healthy cash flows from operations going forward. Capital contribution for the infrastructure development in new GAs has been made from the accruals of the company. AGL&rsquo;s strategy is to fast track development of steel pipeline laying and setting up of CNG stations to initiate early development of eco system in the New GA&rsquo;s </span></p>
        <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Commenting on the annual results of the Company<strong>, Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Group </strong>said, &ldquo;Adani Gas Limited is on its way to build a formidable network of CGD across the nation. It is truly gratifying to see the resilience of team AGL in maintaining the flow of essential services while ensuring safety during such trying times of COVID 19 Lockdown. It is this commitment to safety, sustainability and core values of nation building which will be instrumental in overcoming the crisis and we are confident of India's ability to revive its economic growth engine and power up through hard work for the next phase of prosperity for its vast population.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Mr. Suresh Manglani, CEO of Adani Gas </span></strong><span>s</span><span>aid, &ldquo;Adani Gas has stood firm with its consumers and government authorities in ensuring uninterrupted supply of PNG and CNG during these challenging times of COVID 19. Team AGL has demonstrated once again its commitment and delivered all round superior physical and financial performance. AGL has immediately recalibrated its process and provided unmatched digital solutions for safe home stay to our consumers. We are excited and committed towards India&rsquo;s vision of Clean and Green energy. Along with this, AGL will look forward for significant synergy to be explored between city gas distribution and retail fuel.&rdquo;</span></p>
