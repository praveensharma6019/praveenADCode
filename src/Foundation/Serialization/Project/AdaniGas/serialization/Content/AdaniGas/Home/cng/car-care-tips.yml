        <p class="mb-3 pl-4">CNG is gaseous fuel and is a mixture of hydrocarbons mainly Methane. It is natural gas compressed to a pressure of 200-250 Kg/cm&sup2; to enhance the vehicle on-board storage capacity. Thus, the compressed form of NG is used as a fuel for transportation purposes.</p>
        <h2 class="heading pl-4 mb-2">DONT'S</h2>
        <ul class="ul-bullets ml-4" dir="ltr">
            <li>Avoid over filling of CNG tank.</li>
            <li>Avoid filling your CNG tank completely as additional gas, it would simply slop around or disperse out.</li>
            <li>Avoid over usage of Air-conditioners/Heaters.</li>
            <li>Never drive till tank is empty.</li>
             <li>CNG gas might evaporate from the tank if there is some passage or leakage in the gas lead.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading pl-4 mb-2 mt-4">DO'S</h2>
        <ul class="ul-bullets ml-4" dir="ltr">
            <li>Always remember to tight the CNG gas lead.</li>
            <li>Remember to park your car in shade Whenever possible, park your car in shade or under tree so that it doesn&rsquo;t allow the sunlight to pass in the car, thereby, protecting the chances of CNG gas evaporation.</li>
            <li>While traveling in a CNG car, always ensure that you use the ACs or the heaters to a minimum extent, as ACs/heaters consume ample of energy.</li>
            <li>Always maintain the tyre pressure.</li>
            <li>Always keep your car engine tuned up.</li>
            <li>A smooth running engine always churns better performance and delivers excellent fuel economy.</li>
            <li>Change air-filters at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>Inspection of engines air-filter at regular interval is necessary to keep your CNG car tuned up. If the air-filters are blocked with dirt or dust, the engine consumes more fuel and churns lesser performance.</li>
            <li>Replace spark plugs and if possible use special spark plugs meant for CNG cars.</li>
            <li>Service frequently.</li>
            <li>Get CNG tuning done by a specialist.</li>
            <li>Always keep your cars&rsquo; tires properly inflated as under inflated tires consume more energy to run, thereby resulting in lesser fuel economy.</li>
