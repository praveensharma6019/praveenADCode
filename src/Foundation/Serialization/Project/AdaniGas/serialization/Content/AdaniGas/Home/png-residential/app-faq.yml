        Is Piped Natural Gas, as a domestic fuel, better than LPG?

        <div class="p-4">
        <p>Yes, Piped Natural Gas (PNG) is definitely a better fuel for your kitchen, then LPG. PNG gives you the advantage of an uninterrupted supply, saves you from the effort of booking a refill or changing cylinders, and helps you enjoy more kitchen space, as PNG reaches you through pipelines. Moreover, no pilferage is experienced in case of PNG, as the invoicing is done for the exact quantity of PNG utilized by the customer as per the meter reading.</p>

        <p>The supply is absolutely regular. The pipeline distribution network is based on an on-line supply system which consists of safety valves and regulators that control and monitor the gas supply and pressure, and assist in identifying system leaks. Thus, an uninterrupted supply at requisite pressure is provided
