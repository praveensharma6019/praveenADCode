        <p>No, ATGL is not the only company to have received such gas composition. ATGL Ahmedabad has only started receiving heavy gas composition. SGL in Mehsana, IRM in Banaskantha already getting this rich gas, other CGD companies such as IGL in Delhi and MGL in Mumbai also periodically receive such rich gas.

        <p>Adani Total Gas Limited (ATGL) is supplying Gas, sourced from its Suppliers. So far gas been supplied to ATGL in Ahmedabad was lean meaning thereby having higher methane content. But this has changed since 28.12.2019 Gas being supplied to ATGL is now rich with heavier hydrocarbons. Due to increased heavy hydrocarbons in Natural Gas, the density of gas has increased resulting into higher dispensed KGs into your CNG cylinder.

        <div class="p-4">
        <p>Cylinder capacity is designed and designated in terms of Water Liters (WL).
        </p>
        <p>A typical cylinder for 4 wheelers is of approx. 60 &ndash; 70 WL capacity and that of 3 wheelers is approx. 30 WL capacity. The cylinder is tested at typically 334 Kg/Cm2 and therefore can contain pressure up to 200 Kg/cm2. It is never defined in terms of amount of gas contents in KG in a cylinder. So long as gas filled in cylinder does not exceed the pressure rating of cylinder, it is safe. So ATGL fills gas at 200 Kg/cm2.
        </p>
        <p>Rich gas filled at 200 Kg/cm2 will weigh more than lean gas filled at 200 Kg/cm2 but that does not mean we are exceeding the capacity. So far ATGL, Ahmedabad was receiving lean gas and now since it has started receiving rich gas, gas getting filled in cylinder at same pressure is more in Kg than what customer is used to get.

        <p>No, Customer shall only pay money for KGs being filled in their CNG cylinder. The only difference is that there will be larger amount of Gas (KGs) being filled in your CNG cylinder.
