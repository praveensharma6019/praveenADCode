        Is it safe to use PNG as an industrial fuel?

        <div class="p-4">
        <p>It is absolutely safe to use PNG as a fuel for industrial applications. The Meter &amp; Regulating Station (MRS) installed in your premise has an in-built safety system, which ensures tripping of regulator, in case of over pressure (choking) or under pressure (leakage). Moreover, Natural Gas is lighter than air, and therefore if there is a leakage it disperses easily in air. It also has the narrowest flammability range of 5-15% which makes it difficult to catch fire in case of leakage.

        <p> The supply is absolutely regular. The pipeline distribution network is an &lsquo;on-line&rsquo; supply system that consists of safety valves and regulators that control and monitor the gas supply and pressure, and assist in identifying system faults and ensures uninterrupted supply at requisite pressure.
