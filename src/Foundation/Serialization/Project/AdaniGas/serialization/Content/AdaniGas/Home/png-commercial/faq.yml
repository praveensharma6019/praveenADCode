        Is it safe to use PNG as a commercial fuel?

        <div class="p-4">
        <p> It is absolutely safe to use PNG as a fuel for commercial applications. The Metering skid installed in your premise has an In- built safety system, which ensures tripping of regulator, in case of over pressure (Choking) or under pressure (leakage). Moreover, Natural Gas is lighter than air, and therefore in case of any accidental leakage it disperses easily in air. Natural Gas also has the narrowest flammability range of 5-15% which makes it difficult to catch fire in an event of leakage.

        <p> The supply is absolutely regular. The pipeline distribution network is an &ldquo;on-line&rdquo; supply system that consists of safety valves and regulators that control and monitor the gas supply and pressure, and assist in identifying system faults and ensures un- interrupted supply at requisite pressure.

You may get in touch with either your genset supplier or specific agencies that are in the job of converting DG sets to gas gensets. However it has been the experience that such conversion is not very efficient and hence it may be advisable to purchase new gas based generating set. It is therefore advisable that you inform us at our Customer Care Office or call up on Customer Care Help-desk clearly mentioning the period for which the gas is not going to be used.
