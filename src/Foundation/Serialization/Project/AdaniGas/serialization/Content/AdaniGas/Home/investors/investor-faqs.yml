        <p class="mb-3">To dematerialize your holding, you should first have an account with a Depository Participant (DP) of your choice. You may then hand-over to your DP, the certificates along with the Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF). Only the securities registered in your name can be submitted for dematerialization. Your DP will then send the DRF and the certificates to Link Intime and an electronic request will also be sent through the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) or Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) network reconfirming the same. Link Intime will verify the documents and if found in order, the dematerialization request will be confirmed to NSDL/CDSL who will in turn inform your DP.</p>
        <p>In the books of the Company, your folio with Link Intime will be debited and the account of NSDL/CDSL will be credited in respect of such dematerialized securities. NSDL/CDSL in their electronic records will credit the account of your DP. Your DP will then credit your account with the number of securities that have been dematerialized and the securities will thereafter be held in electronic form. This process would take approximately 15-20 days.</p>
