I want us to be able to look back and reflect that the Adani Group did its bit to help build a more self-reliant India – the nation that is second to none in its defence manufacturing capabilities – the nation that is stronger in its ability to defend itself. As an Indian - there could be nothing more gratifying. It is a critical milestone for the trusted and strategic relationship between our nations - India and Israel. This joint venture facility for the manufacturing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is a testament to Elbit’s commitment to our nation and the ‘Make in India’ programme”</p>
        
        <p><strong>Speaking about Elbit Systems’ commitment to India, Bezhalel Machilis, President and Chief Executive Officer, Elbit Systems added</strong> – “This facility where the Hermes 900 (MALE) and the Hermes 450 – the most advanced UAV systems in the world – will be manufactured, is in line with the Indian government's strategic plan and enables us to share our extensive experience in defense systems and benefit from the dedicated Indian workforce. Adani Group has a long history of entrepreneurship, spanning through decades of dynamic growth. We are proud of our enduring relationship with Adani Group and look forward to partnering in developing defence ecosystem in India.”</p>
