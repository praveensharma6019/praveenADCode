            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><span><strong>Lucknow, June 03, 2022:</strong></span> The <strong>Government of Uttar Pradesh</strong> signed a <strong>Memorandum of  Understanding</strong> at the eve of the  Global  Investors’  Summit in Lucknow to set up  South  Asia’s largest integrated manufacturing facility in  Uttar  Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">In his address at the UP summit,<strong> Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group</strong> highlighted the importance of having self-reliance in high quality ammunition and the manufacturing complex is Adani Defence’s endeavour towards equipping our Armed Forces with state-of-the-art battlefield equipment.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Speaking on the eve of the signing of the MoU, CEO, UP Expressways & Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) and <strong>Additional Chief Secretary, Awanish Kumar Awasthi</strong>, said this project is going to prove as a landmark in the history of indigenous defence manufacturing.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Giving more details about the plans to build South Asia’s largest manufacturing facility, <strong>Ashish Rajvanshi, President & CEO of Adani Defence & Aerospace</strong>, said, “With our vision of nation-building combined with the clarion call of Atmanirbhar Bharat by the Honourable <strong>Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi</strong> ji, we are setting up South Asia’s largest integrated ammunition complex in the Uttar Pradesh Defence Corridor. The ammunition complex will have state-of-the-art technology across small and medium calibre ammunition, along with short-range air defence missiles. It shall be a key facilitator in India’s goal of achieving US$5.0 billion exports in defence manufacturing.”</p>
        	<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The complex, which is spread over 250+ acres and an investment of around <strong>1,500Cr</strong> is slated to have state-of-the-art technology across small and medium calibre ammunition, along with short-range air defence missiles. There are plans to hire around 1,500 people, who will use the best-in-class technologies to manufacture high-quality ammunition for domestic and export markets.</p>
        	<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Aligned to the Make-In-India vision, Adani Defence and Aerospace has bolstered its vision to make the country’s defence manufacturing self-reliant with several such initiatives in the recent past, which includes India’s first unmanned aerial vehicles manufacturing facility and India’s first private sector small arms manufacturing facility.</p>
        	<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Rajvanshi</strong> concluded, “The recent geopolitical events have further reinforced that self-reliance in defence and security has to be accelerated. Unmanned platforms, short range missiles and ammunitions, cyber defence coupled with AI/ML driven analytics will become the decisive factors in the future wars and conflicts.”
