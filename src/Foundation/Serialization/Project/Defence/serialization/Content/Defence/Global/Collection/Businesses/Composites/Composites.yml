        <p class="mb-3 d-block"><strong>Aerospace grade composites owing to their high strength and reduced weight have enabled manufacturers to significantly improve the performance of military and civilian aircraft. Adani Defence and Aerospace has established a 20 acre Adani Aerospace Park in Hyderabad comprising a 50,000 sq. ft. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Complex.</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-none">The first production order being executed from the facility is for the complete carbon composite airframe for Hermes 900 MALE UAV for an international customer.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-none">With the aim of supporting the DPSUs, the capacity shall be doubled in the coming years to cater to critical programs like AMCA. To augment the work-force capability in the area of composites manufacturing a Training and Certification institute is being set up for providing training in the latest methods in composites manufacturing.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-none">Comprotech Engineering, an Adani Group company, is engaged in the manufacturing of composite aerostructures which includes layup process, compression molding, sandwiched honeycombed structures and tooling for DRDO, DPSUs and the armed forces of India.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-none">To keep our promise of building foundational capabilities, we are engaged with Solvay, the global leader in composite materials solutions, for potential collaboration on aerospace composite materials for India.</p>
