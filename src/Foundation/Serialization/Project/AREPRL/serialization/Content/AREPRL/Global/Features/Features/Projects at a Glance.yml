        <p>The selected project locations are in high solar irradiance zones which makes them favorable locations for solar PV projects. Also, the plot sizes are regular in shape allowing for optimum utilization of the resources from an engineering perspective.</p>
        <p>The project will also have a boundary wall along its entire periphery, an on-site rain-water harvesting system and sprinkler mechanism for the maintenance of a green area, an administrative building, material storage shed and parking shed, a weather monitoring station, landscaped premises and aesthetically-designed buildings.</p>
