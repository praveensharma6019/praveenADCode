        <p class="text-black mb-5"><a href="#">Dr. Harshil Modi is an AVMA alumnus from the batch of 2016. He has completed 4.5 years of MBBS and was undergoing internship at Baroda Medical College, M.S. University. His small, middle-class family includes his mother and brother &ndash; the siblings were raised single-handedly by the mother amidst many difficulties. It is from her that Harsh has learnt to face hardships with great fortitude. In a similar manner, he is grateful to Adani Vidya Mandir, Ahmedabad and credits his teachers for channelizing his energy in the right direction. The clarity of thought he developed at school and the moral values which were stressed upon in school, made him a compassionate person and this very quality is making him excel in the medical field. He considers AVMA as a boon for providing him the right platform to fulfil his dream of becoming a doctor.

        <p class="text-black mb-5"><a href="#">Dipesh Rafaliya, an AVMA alumnus of the batch of 2014, is currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, USA. He is a part of a team which uses cutting edge technology for developing the best-in-class mobile applications. He considers himself fortunate to have studied at Adani Vidya Mandir, Ahmedabad where he got the right motivation and mentoring. His childhood fascination with computers got more impetus when he was introduced to the subject Computer &amp; Information Technology in school. The countless opportunities such as being vice-captain or participating in extracurricular activities during assembly, sports events, and celebrations helped him develop many interpersonal and soft skills. He particularly remembers the field trips at school and how they ignited a passion in him to opt for Information Technology (IT). He believes that if the base of the building is strong, the building would stand tall &ndash; a belief that he has been able to make true as an engineer at FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google). </a></p>

        <p class="text-black mb-5"><a href="#">Mohmad Sakil Osman Gani belongs to the fisherfolk community of Luni village, Kutch. His father is a Pagadiya fisherman &ndash; he practices foot fishing in the near-shore areas or intertidal areas to support his family of eight. Pagadiyas undergo great hardships to make a living and their children invariably end up in the same occupation. However, Sakil&rsquo;s story is different &ndash; he joined AVMB in 2014-15 in class 7 as a first generation learner. He was very reserved at first and was finding the conditions at school very different &ndash; almost alien. AVMB provided counselling and support to him as well as his parents. His confidence got an immense boost after securing 1st Position at the Khel Maha Kumbh (District Level) in Running. Then, he secured 2nd Position in class X. For a child who could not even fathom getting such a platform, this was a turning point. His true journey to self-discovery and building a career began now. Today, he is a mechanical engineer who is not only supporting his family but has become a role model for many in his community.</a></p>

        <p class="text-black mb-5"><a href="#">Mandeepsinh Kunwarsinh Gohil is the son of a farmer who hails from Botad (Gujarat). His family of 5 &ndash; including parents and siblings &ndash; toils endlessly to make ends meet. Mandeepsinh&rsquo;s childhood was spent working in the farm or doing menial labour jobs, while sporadically attending a small school in Gadhada, Botad. Things changed when Mandeepsinh&rsquo; uncle intervened and encouraged him to apply for admission at AVMB in class 7. He could now devote all his time to being student and do the things that children of his age do. His intelligence, hard work, sincerity and teachers&rsquo; support led him to excel in academics. He was able to pass class 10 exams with flying colours.
        The staff at AVMB and Adani Foundation supported him with career guidance, aptitude assessment and financial means for further studies &ndash; he finally pursued mechanical engineering at HJD Institute of Engineering, Kera (Kutch). Today, Mandeepsinh is an engineer, standing on his own two feet and providing better living conditions to his family.

        <p class="text-black mb-5"><a href="#">Manas Rajgor is a student of class X who belongs to Vadala, Kutch. He was always good at studies and well-mannered. Things became shaky with the onset of the pandemic induced restrictions. Online classes did not have the same impact as regular schooling did. Distractions in the form of online games became easy to fall prey to, resulting in his absence from online classes.
        The school team, including the principal, paid a home visit to check for his well-being. They learnt that Manas&rsquo; parents were struggling to get Manas to stay at home and attend online classes. He was behaving recklessly at home, demanding more money, and not responding to the teachers&rsquo; pleas. After around 6 home visits and daily telephonic counselling by different members from the school for about 2 months, the child showed positive response and self-correction. He performed very well in both the preliminary examinations and his parents are also relieved as class X is a crucial year, academically.

        <p class="text-black mb-5"><a href="#">The academic year 2021-22 was challenging in an unprecedented manner for all the stakeholders of AVMS. During the pandemic, AVMS made the best use of technology. Online Classes were conducted via <strong>Google Classroom</strong> and <strong>WhatsApp</strong>. The dormant, but indomitable spirit of young learners of AVMS was rekindled by the introduction of online classes, making them familiar with digital tools and even exciting them at the myriad possibilities. Where the online classes could not bridge the gap wholly, the faculty of AVMS went door to door, fulfilling the learning requirements of each child. The <strong>terminal examination</strong> was also held online, and evaluation was conducted digitally. This was a novel experience for both students and teachers.
        The <strong>AVMS Faculty</strong> empowered themselves with the help of workshops to cope with the prevailing digital requirements of students in academics.
        The annual examination was conducted offline, mobilizing the support of parents in the respective locality of the students. Further, AVMS initiated <strong>mohalla classes</strong> to facilitate the Class X students in their preparation for <strong>CBSE Board Examination</strong>. The Class X students were divided into three batches to ensure the social distancing as per the <strong>Covid-19</strong> guidelines and classes for the three different batches were simultaneously conducted in the school vicinity. The first batch of AVMS appeared for the Board Examination in May, 2021.
