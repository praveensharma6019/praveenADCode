        Shreya Shrimali, an AVMA alumnus of the batch of 2016, is a national level athlete who is currently pursuing International MBA in Global Sports Management & Business from EDC Paris Business School. She attributes her achievements as an athlete to AVMA as her exploration of sports began at school. She credits her sports teacher for discovering her abilities and the school for all the support provided for her transformation into a national level sportsperson. Starting from school level to national level athletics championships, she has come a long way – she was a state champion for 3 years in 100m hurdles and has won several medals in 100m sprint, 200m sprint and relay races.
        Amongst her many laurels, the closest to her heart is receiving “AVMA - PLAYER OF THE YEAR” award – as it was the validation at school that built her confidence and groomed her. Apart from nurturing her sporting talent, she credits the school for shaping her personality, English speaking skills and providing her with right education which has helped her in pursuing higher level education abroad.
