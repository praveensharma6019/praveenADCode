      Hint: Body
      Value: "Mohmad Sakil Osman Gani belongs to the fisherfolk community of Luni village, Kutch. His father is a Pagadiya fisherman – he practices foot fishing in the near-shore areas or intertidal areas to support his family of eight. Pagadiyas undergo great hardships to make a living and their children invariably end up in the same occupation. However, Sakil’s story is different – he joined AVMB in 2014-15 in class 7 as a first generation learner. He was very reserved at first and was finding the conditions at school very different – almost alien. AVMB provided counselling and support to him as well as his parents. His confidence got an immense boost after securing 1st Position at the Khel Maha Kumbh (District Level) in Running. Then, he secured 2nd Position in class X. For a child who could not even fathom getting such a platform, this was a turning point. His true journey to self-discovery and building a career began now. Today, he is a mechanical engineer who is not only supporting his family but has become a role model for many in his community."
