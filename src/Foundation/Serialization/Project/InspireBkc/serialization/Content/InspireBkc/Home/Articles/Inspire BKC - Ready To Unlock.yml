                        <p class="lead">COVID-19 has changed the way we interact, travel and work. To say that life will no
                            longer be the same would be stating the obvious. A key fallout of the lockdown triggered by COVID-19
                            is the rise of a work from home (WFH) ecosystem promoting many to write obituaries of the “office”
                            as a space.</p>
                        <p class="lead">However, we do believe that while the way we work will change, office spaces are here to
                            stay. It goes without saying that the nature of the office and architecture will be radically
                            reimagined but we feel that the fundamental aspects of work and collaborative energies that come
                            with an office space may not be replicated by a purely WFH ecosystem.</p>
                        <p class="lead">We believe that thoughtfully designed office spaces continue to provide real value to
                            many major brands and corporate houses across industries and services. Our belief was reinforced
                            recently with the entry of a high-profile brand moving into InspireBKC</p>

                        <p class="lead">Reliance Nippon Life Insurance, one of the biggest names in the insurance sector, leased
                            a space at InspireBKC, our premium commercial space at the Bandra Kurla Complex. Reliance Nippon
                            leased an area measuring 26,796 square feet on the fourth floor, which is nearly 62% of the total
                            carpet area of the floor.</p>
                        <p class="lead">At InspireBKC, we have created a space that caters to the needs to those who seek a
                            collaborative office space. InspireBKC has been designed and built in a way to ensure that business
                            is beautifully blended with health, wellness and leisure.</p>
                        <p class="lead">The key mantra behind designing InspireBKC has been to accommodate and anticipate the
                            changes you may face in your business. This key mantra has kept us in good stead as companies seek
                            to lease flexible office spaces as we unlock our economy. We even have exclusive offices with a
                            terrace garden that serves as a picturesque refuge after a hectic day at work. Our high celling to
                            floor height (4.2 meters) provides a sense of space that is crucial in a post lockdown era where
                            undoubtedly social distancing norms will continue to play a role.</p>

                            providing key amenities such as a full-fledged day-care centre with trained attendants. You can drop
                            off their kids before going to work and be rest assured that if in case of any emergency, you would
                            be in the same building. We also have an in house fitness centre with a well equipped gym and
                            trained fitness instructors who will assist you through tailored fitness programmes.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Lastly, InspireBKC has a range of café’s and fine dining options in addition to a food
                            court, allowing you to start your day with a fresh cup of coffee and end it with a succulent dinner
