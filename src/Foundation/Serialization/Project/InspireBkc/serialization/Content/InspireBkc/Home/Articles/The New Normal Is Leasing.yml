                        <p class="lead">The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented situation. It has changed all aspects
                            of our life, including how we work. Recently India implemented the world’s most extensive lockdown
                            and extended it as a part of the business continuity plan across government and private enterprises.
                            Hence, work from home (WFH) has been implemented by most organisations. However, five months into
                            the lockdown, the real estate sector has seen a rebound in leasing because WFH is not a long-time
                            solution for all companies. Moreover, social distancing means that companies require similar or more
                            space to house the same number of employees.</p>
                        <p class="lead"><b>The leasing share of sectors</b></p>
                        <p class="lead">There has been a significant drop in rent collection and transactional volume during
                            COVID-19. Even as there will be a proportion of workforce working from home, from the leasing
                            perspective, it may not have a significant impact. According to industry experts, the impact would
                            be around 10-15 per cent on new leasing in the office workspace market. This dip will be
                            counter-balanced by increasing demand for office spaces from sectors such as healthcare, e-commerce,
                            FMCG and data centres.</p>
                        <p class="lead">The IT sector has the maximum share in leasing and net absorption every year. According
                            to JLL India Real Estate Update Q1 2020 for office space, the IT/ITeS sector contributed to 56 per
                            cent of total leasing. In 2019, the net office space leasing stood at 46.5 mn sq. ft. across seven
                            major cities. The next sector is Banking and Finance, whose share in leasing is 10 per cent.</p>
                        <p class="lead">These sectors are expected to rebound the quickest and while some believe demand may
                            stay muted for a while, other experts feel that recovery may be swift.</p>

                            return to work after a long bout of WFH, companies are adopting a safety first approach.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Companies are using different strategies to de-densify their offices. Some of them

                                    present on any given day. Only employees, who don’t have to rely on public transport, are

                                    now experimenting with a two-shift system. This helps them reduce the number of people in
                                    office and also enables employees beat rush hour congestion (not just on their daily
                                    commutes, but also inside office complexes, especially elevators).</p>

                            distancing is maintained even inside lifts etc. Essentially complexes that have adapted to the

                            inventory. There is also a greater demand for smarter technology to manage the crowd and queues.
                            Even for cinema theatres, technology will play a big part in the movie-going experience as they
                            shift to digital tickets and concessional sales. Companies would need to adopt safety measures such
                            as six-feet social distancing, the use of face masks and checking temperatures before allowing
                            people in. Venues are looking to reduce physical interactions as much as possible.</p>

                            de-densification and splitting up of offices will be the norm to ensure business continuity. The
                            need for de-densification will further drive office leasing demand. For example, 100 people would
                            still require the same office space that housed 200 people before because of social distancing norms
                            in place. Hence, though the demand for office leasing space could see a decline in the short term,
                            things would probably bounce back to normal as soon as the situation improves, which could be as
                            early as the fourth quarter of 2020. Most observers expect demand for office leasing space to
                            improve as we enter into 2021.</p>
