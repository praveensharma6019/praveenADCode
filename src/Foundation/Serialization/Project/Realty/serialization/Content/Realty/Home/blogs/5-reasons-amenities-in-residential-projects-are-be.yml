        Buying a house is a huge decision, especially if it is your first home. Many factors are taken into consideration, and the pros and cons of every option are explored and analysed before buying a home. Statistics show high growth in the Indian real estate market in the past few years, with the rise in demand for office and residential spaces. In 2021 alone, more than 2,32,000 units were sold in India's residential market. It is a 51% increase from last year.

        Getting top amenities for a home is significant for buyers. In real estate, amenities such as a swimming pool, well-equipped club, indoor/outdoor fitness area, kids’ play area etc., attract prospective homebuyers. Let us understand how amenities help a potential homebuyer make a home buying decision. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-3"><strong>
        Why do the amenities of a project attract the attention of potential home buyers?</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-3">
        Lately, home buyers are placing much value on factors that contribute to the leisure and comfort of the occupants and enhance the desirability of real estate. Thus, a strong correlation between the well-being of the residents and social infrastructure is observed. Let's look at why amenities in a project have become the deciding factor in a house purchase.

        •	Escalating Stress Levels:</strong></li>
        <p class="mb-3">
        Growing stress levels, highly competitive professional life, and discomfort of commuting long distances for jobs have all resulted in people looking for comfortable living spaces. After a tiring and exhausting day, they consider their homes as a personal haven where they can relax, and experience happiness.

        <li><p class="mb-3" /><strong>
        •	Community Identity:</strong></li>
        <p class="mb-3">
        Another plausible reason behind all the attention to amenities is the sense of community identity. People come together on holidays, festivals, or events and enjoy camaraderie while enjoying various facilities in a residential project. Thus, when buying a property, they look for top amenities for their home.

Real estate projects in these cities are replete with amenities and modern conveniences that have redefined luxury and comfort. Quality construction and pristine living have become a value proposition for home buyers. After spending hours at the office, they can look forward to making the most of these amenities available in their society.
