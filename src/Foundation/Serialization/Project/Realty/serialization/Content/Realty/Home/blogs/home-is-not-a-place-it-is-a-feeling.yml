        From dwellings focussing on safety and comfort, to high-tech luxury homes, modern day architecture has come a long way since its inception.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The concept of homes has evolved too. Today, they serve more as reflections of their owner's personalities. People want homes that are more spacious, Vaastu compliant and customized as per their need of space. The concept of luxury apartments has become a fad today.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        People have begun to use their homes to express themselves. The younger generation is smarter and finicky about what they want. They are ready to go the extra mile to give their homes an extremely personal touch. Home has definitely become more than just a place to live in, it has become a feeling.</p>

        Property builders are giving the residents the privilege to define every space as per their convenience.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Apart from the exuberant amenities, real estate property developers like Adani Realty, are going the extra mile to offer their patrons with picturesque environment and homes that are within close proximity to every possible convenience - schools, hospitals, transportation, etc. Although these properties come at a premium price, they make worth for every penny paid.</p>
