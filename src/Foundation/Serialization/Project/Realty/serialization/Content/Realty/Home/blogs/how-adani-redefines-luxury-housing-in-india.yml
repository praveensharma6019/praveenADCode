        Nowadays, Indian consumers are more aware of international trends and lifestyles. There is a rising segment from UHNWIs (Ultra High Net worth Individuals) who are attracted to unique and luxurious residences. They expect these residences to have character and class and to be built in some of the best areas of the cities in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, etc. This knowledge, coupled with more spending power and a dearth of true luxury, has made luxury home projects gain popularity over the years in India.</p>

        Regardless of the economic conditions and other market variables, there will always be groups of people who will not be content with just any kind of homes. As a result, demand for luxury housing in India will never go away. This demand is driven by the rising standard of living, increasing disposable income and a thirst for the good life. Other reasons include comfort, security, and technological enablement, aspiration for status, better neighbours, luxurious amenities and investment value.</p>

They want to live in homes that announce their arrival and offer a higher lifestyle rather than just an address. With such demands, the luxury housing markets have witnessed a steady appreciation in prices. Apart from the metros, cities like Chandigarh, Gurgaon, and Ahmedabad are witnessing gradual increase in the luxury housing market.</p>
