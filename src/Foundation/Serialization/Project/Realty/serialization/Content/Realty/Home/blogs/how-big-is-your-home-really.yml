        Buying (or renting) a home can be a confusing time in many people lives; as they hesitatingly navigate a world full of complicated sounding terms and conditions.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        One such point of perplexity, is figuring out what a builder means when he says an apartment is, say, 1200 sq. ft.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        In every residential complex, there are three ways of calculating the area, or the square footage &ndash; the Carpet Area, the Built-Up area and the Super Built-Up area. They may sound similar, but there is in fact, a big difference between them.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        As the name suggests, <strong>Carpet Area</strong> is the entire area over which you could spread a carpet &ndash; that is, the inner wall-to-wall measurement inside the house. This would also include, steps if any, inside the house, but does not include the thickness of the walls. So essentially, Carpet area is the net usable area inside the house.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The <strong>Built Up Area</strong> is the total covered area of the apartment or <a href="/commercial-projects">commercial property</a> unit. It can be calculated by adding areas of utility ducts within property unit, internal and external walls to the carpet area.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The <strong>Super Built Up Area</strong> is the built up area plus proportionate area of common areas such as the lobby, lifts shaft, stairs, etc. Sometimes it may also include the common areas such, swimming pool, garden, clubhouse, etc.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The bottom-line? When you are in search of a house, look at the carpet area and then make your decision, because that is the number that will give you an idea of the actual space at your disposal. Focusing on the carpet area will help you understand the usable area in the kitchen, bedrooms, living room, etc.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Real Estate may be a large and complicated domain, but knowledge is power, and a little information will go a long way in helping you make the right choice when buying a home.</p>
