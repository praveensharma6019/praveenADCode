        <p class="mb-2"><span>Adani Realty has its eyes set on becoming one of the top builders in Pune<strong>. </strong>The landscape here is bound to change for they have stepped in with the launch of their maiden project at Koregaon Park NX. Here are some of the details of the new project in Pune that is set to redefine luxury.</span></p>
        <h3 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Adani Realty&rsquo;s Maiden Venture</h3>
        <p class="mb-2"><span>Adani Realty, with its various projects in Mumbai and Ahmedabad, has now turned its attention towards Pune and has chosen Koregaon Park to make its monumental debut with exclusive 2, 2.5 and 3 BHK apartments.</span></p>
        <h3 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Why Koregaon Park</h3>
        <p class="mb-2"><span>Koregaon Park is undoubtedly an <strong>esteemed address in Pune</strong>, with its verdant green cover. The locational advantages make it one of the most favoured locations in town. The Pune Railway Station, which is also the gateway to South India, is approximately only 3 kms away and the Pune Airport is approximately 6 kms away.</span></p>
        <p class="mb-2"><span>The Osho Meditation Resort which is in the proximity, adds a touch of serenity and the presence of a lot of foreigners, gives it a multicultural vibe. </span></p>
        <p class="mb-2"><span>Here, major retail avenues and entertainment zones are located within reach. It&rsquo;s easy to satiate your gastronomic desires with a wide range of high end, multi cuisine restaurants to local street side stalls. The iconic German Bakery and Hotel Westin are also nearby. </span></p>
        <p class="mb-2"><span>This area is also the hub of cultural activity. The Chabad House, located just a couple of minutes away, is where rich Jewish heritage meets Maharashtrian. </span></p>
        <h3 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Features and Amenities</h3>
        <p class="mb-2"><span>The project is Vaastu compliant. Apartments are East-West facing, for it is not only perfect from the Vaastu perspective but also ensures that every apartment gets its quota of sunlight and ventilation each day. </span></p>
        <p class="mb-2"><span>There is air-conditioning in each <a href="/residential-projects/atelier-greens">2 BHK flat in Pune</a> to provide the highest degree of comfort as the temperature and humidity levels do tend to rise.</span></p>
        <p class="mb-2">Constructing two clubhouses is part of the plan to cater to the recreational needs of our residents. Each apartment will get ample parking space to park their cars and two-wheelers. Koregaon Park has an ample green cover and to enhance this, vertical gardens are part of the proposed residential complex.</p>
        <p class="mb-2"><span>Do experience the 20+ amenities of this debut project, and Adani Realty hopes to make it one of the best <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">residential projects in the historic city of Pune</strong>.</span></p>
