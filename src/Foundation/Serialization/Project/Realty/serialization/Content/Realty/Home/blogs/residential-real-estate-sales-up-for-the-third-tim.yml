        Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>

        According to Pankaj Kapoor, MD, Liases Foras, sales of homes under Rs 25 lakh in the top eight cities have remained stagnant on a year-on-year basis and dropped 25% on a quarter-on-quarter basis because they are often built in locations which are not feasible for end users.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        This puts Affordable Housing projects like <a href="/residential-projects/aangan">Aangan by Adani Realty</a> at a distinct advantage as they bring together the best of both worlds - affordability as well as great locations. So far, Adani has two Aangan projects - one at <a href="/residential-projects/shantigram-ahmedabad">Shantigram in Ahmedabad</a>, and the other at Gurgaon, NCR</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Dropping or at least stagnating property prices alongside lowering interest rates are expected to help push home sales in the coming days. The past three quarters have seen a marginal increase in home sales indicating some kind of recovery but a full-fledged one is still some quarters away.</p>
