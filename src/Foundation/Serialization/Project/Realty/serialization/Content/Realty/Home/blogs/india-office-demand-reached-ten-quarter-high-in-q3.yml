        India continues to be a key outsourcing location among global corporates and this is reflective in the steady growth in demand for prime office space. A recent trend that has been noted is the increase in demand for small to medium sized office space.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Additionally, the increasing buzz around REITs in India, better alignment of developers with compliances under the RERA Act (which also covers the commercial segment), and trends in the global outsourcing industry are also likely to impact the commercial real estate sector in the coming quarters</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        All of these reflect in the commercial real estate market in India, which continues to grow at a steady pace. Positive changes in policy and regulations have given a further boost to the sector.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        A sector-wise analysis of the quarter&rsquo;s office space take-up revealed that IT/ITeS firms continued to lead office transaction activity, accounting for about 54% of the deal closures. Besides the IT/ITeS sector, BFSI, and Engineering &amp; Manufacturing were the other sectors driving demand for office space. Both these sectors accounted for about 10-11% share each in quarterly space absorption, mostly led by transactions closed in Mumbai and Chennai.</p>
