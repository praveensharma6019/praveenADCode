        We&rsquo;re all victims of storage crunch; struggling to stuff our things in every possible corner of the room - trying to wriggle in the last pair of clothes in the wardrobe or shoving the last pair of shoes in the shoe rack. And although storage hacks over the internet are available dime a dozen, there are barely a few that we can put to best use.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        If you often find yourself in a cramming session, struggling with space, here&rsquo;s a consolidated list of DIY tips to make the most of your own little bedroom!</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        A cutting board, a couple of coated steel wires, pincers, a drill, a hook, and leather are all that you need to make this fancy little table that you can hang anywhere.

        If you have more clothes than you can shove in every corner of the room, it&rsquo;s time you consider having an open closet. Fix a clothes rack in an empty corner of the room, and voila! You now hang your ironed clothes and not worry about the every morning hunt, searching for them. You can also show off your fancy collection of designer clothes (Just saying ;)). Make sure that you fix the rack away from the window, to protect the clothes from dust.&nbsp;</p>

        If you buy a lot of books, only to stack them in different drawers of your room because you&rsquo;re running tight on space, you could do with some drawers from old furniture. Arrange the drawers (of different sizes, preferably) to make a skeleton of a hanging shelf. And your mini-library is ready to be loaded with books. If you own a huge collection of books, you could even have different genres in each drawer! Ain&rsquo;t that cool?</p>
