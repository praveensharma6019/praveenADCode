        The bustling midnight munches at Manek Chowk, the intellectual missions at IIM and the soothing sounds of flowing waters define the city of Karnavati. Yes, that&rsquo;s the name by which Ahmedabad was known by, until the 1400s. Located on the banks of the Sabarmati River, Ahmedabad is the 7th most populated in the country. It has slowly and steadily emerged as an important industrial hub in India complimenting the business capital state of the country, Gujarat. But all this aside, Ahmedabad is also among the prime locations in the country where one can live.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">
        The Divine Aura:</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Authentic, Humble, Modern, Educational-hub, Divine, Active, Beautiful, Alcohol-free &amp; Dazzling are just a few words to describe life in Ahmedabad! The serenity of the Sabarmati Ashram, the peaceful environs of the Jama Masjid and the divine aura of the Swaminarayan Temple, illustrate the history and culture of this beautiful city. The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Museum, Bhadra Fort, Calico Museum of Textiles, Kankaria Zoo, Auto World Vintage Car Museum, Nagina Wadi and Vastrapur Lake are just some other salient spots which make the city a pride to live in. Ahmedabad also rates high on the safety index. The time of Navratri, where the city dances till the wee hours of morning is a prime example of that.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">
        The Convenient Commute Modes:</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Commute modes within the city are easily accessible and convenient. Auto rickshaws are easily available.

Taxis can also be booked on a daily basis or as per requirements in which the driver stays with you for the complete journey and also help you understand alternative shortcut routes for places you want to visit.</p>

        Food is another reason why you would want to live in the city. Just like Mumbai has its mid-night indulgence zones, Ahmedabad too is not behind. Head straight to Manek Chowk to satisfy your midnight hunger pangs. Known especially for serving deliciously delightful chocolate cheese, pineapple cheese sandwiches and hot biryanis, Manek Chowk lights up the night with its numerous stalls. Grand Bhagwati, The Upper Crust, Rasranjan and Mirch Masala are some of the top places to try out for the yummiest of desserts and authentic cuisines.</p>
