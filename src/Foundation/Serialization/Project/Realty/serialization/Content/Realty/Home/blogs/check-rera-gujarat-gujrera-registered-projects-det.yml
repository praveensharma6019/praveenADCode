                Has buying a new home been the most cherished dream of your life? The answer from most of you is likely to be a
                yes. In 2017, Gujarat’s state government published the overarching rules for the Gujarat Real Estate (Regulation
                and Development) Act, putting the <strong>Gujarat RERA (GUJRERA)</strong> into effect ever since. <strong>RERA
                    Gujarat</strong> supervises the
                real estate sector in Gujarat and protects the rights of home buyers.

            <p class="mb-3">
                <b>What is RERA Gujarat?</b>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                The Gujarat Regulation and Development Act, or GujRERA, is recognised for effectively controlling the state's
                real estate market. RERA protects both homeowners' and developers' rights through governmental rules created and
                implemented in the RERA Act. The online portal provides solutions for registration and project/agent compliance,
            </p>
        
            <p class="mb-2">
                Purchasing a RERA-approved home means you are choosing a vetted property. Hence, customers looking to buy a home
                in Gujarat must ensure the RERA Act Gujarat approves it
            </p>
        
            <p class="mb-2">
                This Act also requires all residential and commercial real estate developers to register.
            </p>
        
            <p class="mb-3">
                RERA has been translated into nearly all Indian languages, so you can easily find <strong>RERA Gujarat Rules in
                    Gujarati.</strong>

                To check the project details in RERA, follow these steps:
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-3">How to Check Status of RERA-registered Projects?</h2>
        
            <p class="mb-3">
                Before purchasing a property, a new home buyer should check the status of RERA-registered projects. When buying
                a home, this assures accountability and transparency.
            </p>
        
            <p class="mb-3">
                <b>Here is how you can check the status of RERA-registered projects:</b>
            </p>
        
            <ul class="bulletpoints mb-3">
                <li>Go to the <strong>RERA Gujarat website</strong> - https://gujrera.gujarat.gov.in/</li>
                <li>Go to the 'REGISTRATION' tab on GujRERA's home page.</li>
                <li>When you select 'PROJECTS,' the search returns a table containing information on projects that have been
                    registered under RERA Gujarat. It includes RERA Ahmedabad and RERA Vadodara.</li>
                <li>Choose from residential, commercial, mixed-use, or planned developments by clicking on any.</li>

            <h2 class="mb-3">How to Check the RERA Registration Number of a Builder</h2>
        
            <p class="mb-3">
                It's essential to understand what the RERA Act entails. RERA establishes separate laws and regulators for
                India's state and union territories. RERA defines specific rules that every builder must follow to increase
                transparency in the real estate business. After the project has been registered with the Regulatory Authority, a
                new project’s promoter can market it for sale.
            </p>
        
            <h2 class="mb-3">Gujarat RERA: List of Approved Projects</h2>
        
            <p class="mb-2">
                The list of authorised projects and agents has been posted on Gujarat's real estate regulatory authority's
                website, from where you can do a <strong>RERA approval check</strong> before purchasing a home. Before making a
                buying decision,
                you should review the approved list of projects. Experts will urge you to buy real estate projects only from
                licensed developers to avoid future problems.

            <p class="mb-2">
                Many purchasers are still unaware that it is now essential to examine whether or not the project they are
                purchasing is registered with their state's Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). Many of them aren't even

            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                It is simple to check a developer's registration on a state's RERA website. Moreover, before purchasing any
                property, you can verify the project’s progress on the RERA website. Also, double-check that the project's
                specifications are present in the property you're considering purchasing.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                On the RERA website, you must review the facts regarding the project you are interested in. RERA's website
                validates whether a project has been registered and displays its specifications. The website also provides
                information on numerous active initiatives in your area.
