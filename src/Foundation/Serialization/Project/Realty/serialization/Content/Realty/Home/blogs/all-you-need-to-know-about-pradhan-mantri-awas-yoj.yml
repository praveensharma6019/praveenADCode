        There are many words that have captured the soul of India until now: the ancient Greeks entitled it as &lsquo;Indoi&rsquo; (people of Indus), subsequently the world started calling it &lsquo;The Golden Sparrow&rsquo; and then gradually &lsquo;Bharat&rsquo;. Most people who have lived here would also know it as &ndash; center of expensive real estate. But with the introduction of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, a bold initiative taken by the Government of India, it is a concrete effort by them to help you get your dream home at an affordable price.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        During the governments celebration of completing three years in office, one challenging opportunity remained - Housing for all by 2022. Launched in 2015, on 29th June, this massive-scale project aims to support the common man to own a home, latest by 2022. The immediate target of PMAY is to construct 1 Crore affordable homes in rural areas by the year 2018-2019.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        In order to avail a house or financial reinforcements from the government, every applicant needs to meet the eligibility criteria set by the PMAY committee.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Individuals who belong to the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), people who earn an annual income of less than Rs.3 lakh.</li>
            <li>
            People that fall under the Light Income Group (LIG), who have an annual income of Rs.3 lakh- Rs.6 lakh.</li>
            <li>
            Those whose annual income is below Rs.12 lakh fall under the Medium Income Group (MIG1) category. These people can avail loans of up to Rs.9 lakh for the construction of a residence.</li>
            <li>
            Individuals earning an annual income, between Rs.12 to Rs.18 lakh will fall under the Medium Income Group (MIG2) category. These people can avail loans of up to Rs.12 lakh.</li>
            <li>
            People hailing from minority groups like SC/ST/OBC will also be considered under the PMAY scheme, but they need to provide relevant caste and income certificates.</li>
            <li>
            Women belonging to EWS/LIG categories will also be considered if they apply under the PMAY scheme.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2">
        But what is the PMAY scheme exactly?</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Since the PMAY scheme is aimed towards the needy, the following features will be implemented:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            The Government of India will provide an interest subsidy of 6.5% on housing loans availed by the beneficiaries for a period of 15 years from the commencement of their loan tenure.</li>
            <li>
            During the allocation of houses under the scheme of PMAY, the preference in allocating the ground floors will be given to the senior citizens and to the differently-abled.</li>
            <li>
            All the houses built under PMAY scheme would be carried out through technology and will have eco-friendly compliance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Therefore, the PMAY scheme will hopefully pick up the demand for affordable housing in India and reduce the realty sector&rsquo;s traditional obsession with affluent homebuyers in the cities.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->
