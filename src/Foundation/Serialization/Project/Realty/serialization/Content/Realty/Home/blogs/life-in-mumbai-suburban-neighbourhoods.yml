        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Life in Mumbai's suburban neighbourhoods</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">In a city with over 22 million people, space would understandably stand at a premium. In the past decade, the residential real estate market of Mumbai has encountered a paradigm shift, with the influx of people from across the country. Lack of space and a burgeoning number of people would lead you to believe that living in the suburbs would be restrictive, but it is, in fact, the opposite. An increasing number of <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=AC54DE8263DF4D7DB77A3B2F225CAEDA&amp;_z=z">real estate developers in Mumbai</a>&nbsp;are now shifting their focus to luxurious yet affordable homes in the suburbs by creating niche apartment complexes that offer a vast range of modern-day lifestyle amenities.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">If you are on the lookout for modern, spacious homes in Mumbai, then consider these benefits of living in suburbs before you make a decision -
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">More Residential Space</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">The suburbs, in comparison to the rest of the city, have a much broader scope for housing development. The increasing demand for modern affordable homes for first-time buyers has led to unprecedented growth of the residential scenario here. The other neighbourhoods of the city are now saturated with old buildings, and there is too much pressure on land. On the other hand, the infrastructure of the western and central suburbs can still easily support the growing property demand.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Modern Lifestyle Conveniences</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">Public transport, hospitals, schools, colleges, restaurants, hotels, shopping malls, movie theatres and so much more - the suburbs are the perfect convergence for all the modern-day lifestyle conveniences. You are never too far to go anywhere or do anything. The remarkable rise in population has brought newer varieties and options to the suburbs.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Open Spaces and Greenery</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">In addition to lifestyle amenities, the suburbs are also home to a broader expanse of greener patches and open spaces. There are more gardens, parks, trails and clubhouses to enjoy here; not to forget, the beach is accessible from multiple junctions. Overall, this part is relatively breezier and greener with umpteen opportunities for outdoor activities.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Connectivity - Public Transport and Roads</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">If you live in the suburbs, you are at an advantage of being in proximity to all forms of public transport and connecting drives. The completion of the new Metro and Monorail projects will ensure better connectivity than ever. The excellent road and rail connectivity to the rest of the city ensures you can reach anywhere in and around the city with the utmost ease. In addition to that, broader roads and cleanliness in recent years have also made the suburbs appear distinctly improved.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Rapid Development of Residential Projects</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">The rapidly increasing number of upcoming projects in Mumbai is a testament to the growing demand for residential projects. Better infrastructure support and connectivity have made suburbs a hub for new and modern residential projects. New apartment complexes and gated communities are being developed that offer an array of modern amenities including clubhouses, gardens, gyms and playgrounds.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">Among the many suburban neighbourhoods of Mumbai, one of the most sought-after residential hoods is Ghatkopar. The infrastructural boom in the past few years has made Ghatkopar a real estate haven. Thanks to the new flyover and Mumbai Metro, everyday commute has become more simplified and progressive. This, in turn, has led to more modern social developments such as shopping malls, movie theatres, restaurants and other leisure activities. Ghatkopar is now home to a few of the best <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=586ED2DF480D4E4E85E58FCCB33C4BF7&amp;_z=z">luxury apartments in Mumbai</a>&nbsp;that offer the highest quality of living and is gradually becoming a celebrated residential neighbourhood of Mumbai</p>
