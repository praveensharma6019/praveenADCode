        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Things To Know About Luxury Homes In Mumbai</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Imagine a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the vast expanse of the city! Living in nature&rsquo;s lap with breathtaking views of the majestic sea and ample greenery around. <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue"><a href="/residential-projects/western-heights">Luxury apartments in Mumbai</a></strong> are rather dreams for every individual, that while adding to the status symbol, involves all the comforts for an elegant lifestyle. Luxury homes not only involve generous living spaces, but also include an element of exclusiveness.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Being one of the favourite destinations for domestic investors as well as abroad, Mumbai has by far enjoyed a significant demand in the real estate sector. With improved economic activity and a growing desire among individuals to have an opulent lifestyle, coupled with lower interest rates and higher levels of disposable income, Mumbai has witnessed a significant spurt in demand for luxury apartments. However, &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; is a term commonly abused by residential real estate developers for marketing pitches. While not every other residential project earns the &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; tag, it becomes important for individual buyers to examine the dynamics of investment in the residential real estate. Considering&nbsp;<strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">luxury flats in Mumbai</strong>, where the objective is to earn significant capital appreciation or experience an elegant lifestyle, here are a few checkpoints that will help you understand the dynamics of true luxury homes.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Location:</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        One of the most basic and yet one of the most critical parameters - a central location with a posh neighbourhood enables a residential project to earn the luxury tag in India. Easy access to the city&rsquo;s infrastructure, proximity to airports, business zones, social infrastructure as well as entertainment establishments are a few factors that can determine a prime location. A few prime residential localities in Mumbai: Andheri, Worli, Bandra, Powai, South Mumbai, Juhu etc.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Project Density:</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        If the project is over-crowded, it destroys the sole purpose of ambience, convenience, and exclusiveness and hence, it cannot be classified as a luxury home. While there&rsquo;s no particular standard, essentially a one-acre residential project occupying 60 families or below is an ideal condition where an individual can experience a good lifestyle.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Ultra-Modern Amenities:</strong></p>
