        <b>Ahmedabad – A UNESCO World Heritage City</b> </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Ahmedabad is one of the most culturally diverse cities in India, offering a plethora of experiences to its residents as well as locals. It is known the world over for its Navratri and Uttarayan celebrations.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        As per archaeological evidence, the area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, known as Ashaval or Yashoval. It was a well-developed region known for trading and manufacturing. Around this period, Karnadev Solanki, a Chaulukya dynasty ruler, established a city in the area and named it Karnavati. The city of Karnavati and the region of Gujarat saw several rulers and dynasties from Solanki and Vaghela to Delhi Sultanate and Muzaffarid. In the 1400s, the place came under Ahmed Shah's rule, who laid the foundation of a new capital on the banks of the Sabarmati River and renamed it Ahmedabad.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Ahmedabad was designated the first UNESCO World Heritage City of India in 2017 for its architectural and historical masterpieces in the Old City or the walled city. This area comprises streets, pols, mosques and temples dating back centuries. Some of the notable structures in the Old City are Bhadra Tower, Bhadrakali Temple, Ahmed Shah's Mosque, Sidi Saiyad's Mosque, Teen Darwaja, Tombs of Ahmed Shah's Queens, Jami Masjid, and Rani Sipri's Mosque. Other prominent landmarks include Sabarmati Ashram, Sabarmati Riverfront, Kankaria Lake, Adalaj Stepwell, Auto World Vintage Car Museum, and Drive-in Cinema.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">

        <p class="mb-2">Gujarat, in general, and the city of Ahmedabad in particular, has always had a progressive outlook towards life and education. The increase in the number of education institutes and job opportunities has taken that outlook up by a few notches. A growing number of people are relocating to <span class="txt-d-blue">#ProgressiveAhmedabad</span> from other cities and states either for better work opportunities or education. People from within Ahmedabad are also shifting base to be closer to their place of work or study. The city dons a bustling look throughout the day due to an increasing number of malls, restaurants, tech parks, and other recreation areas.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">An area that is fast developing and touted to become the next big thing in Ahmedabad is the city's northwest side. It has various development projects along and close to the Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway. Within a 10-km radius lay many attractions thronged by tourists and locals alike. </p>
