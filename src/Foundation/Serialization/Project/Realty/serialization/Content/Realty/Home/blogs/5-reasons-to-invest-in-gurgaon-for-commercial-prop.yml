        Top 5 reasons why Gurgaon is the place to invest<br />
        <br />
        Often called the &lsquo;Millennium City&rsquo;, the Delhi- National Capital Region (NCR), Gurgaon, has seen rental values skyrocket in recent times. It has emerged as the most attractive destination for real estate investment in the NCR according to a survey by the industry body, PHDCCI.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        With our Prime Minister entitling Gurgaon as a model for smart city projects, with over 500 MNC&rsquo;s&nbsp; and <a href="/commercial-projects">commercial projects</a> working in that place, here are the top 5 reasons, why you should invest in Gurgaon.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Ample choices of luxurious houses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Gurgaon offers a 270 degree panoramic view of the surrounding lush greenery, and is close to the IGI Airport. These iconic buildings are designed 3 dimensionally as spiral structures and are equipped with sophisticated amenities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            100% connected with roadways, railways and airways.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The unique advantage of Gurgaon is that it&rsquo;s a well-connected network comprising Delhi Metro and Rapid Metro System. About 33,000 people use Rapid Metro Gurgaon for their daily transit with three elite coach trains that operate in a loop. The Indira Gandhi International Airport, although situated just outside the Gurgaon city limits, provides domestic and worldwide air connectivity. In addition, it has standard private shuttles and bus routes that provide transport, to and from the city&rsquo;s airport. Furthermore, the major highway, NH-8, links Gurgaon to the other major cities easily.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Impeccable, ingenious and inspiring infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Gurgaon has observed rapid industrialization and urban development over the last decade. With areas such as Dwarka Expressway, Sohna Road, and Golf Course Extension are some good spaces in Gurgaon where property investors can benefit from good return on investment (ROI). The city is also equipped with 100% wide sector roads, spaced with leading hospitals, schools &amp; other educational institutions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            A hub for many multinational companies!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Gurgaon has established its own unique identity of being an IT city because of the surplus multinational companies residing there. It is not only planned to be an ideal destination for homebuyers, but also functions as headquarter for <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=72C91D989C0546CEB62EA2B63A22AF0B&amp;_z=z">commercial office space</a>, such as Coca-Cola, BMW, Pepsi, and Agilent Technologies. It is also an abode to 250 of the Fortune 500 companies and also several startup companies. In addition to this, it is a smart destination for manufacturing businesses, as well, owing to the 100% trouble-free availability of workforce in and around its suburbs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Higher returns against investments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The escalating prices of property in other regions have made people move to Gurgaon because the city is a good market for reasonably priced housing with high-quality infrastructure and it yields the highest returns on investment with a predictable average annual appreciation of 10 to 15%. An added benefit of investing in commercial real estate is that builders are offering smaller units which allows the investors with low budget to invest in a good market.<br />
        Hence, Gurgaon has become the ultimate place for investing in real estate by companies and even the common folk. Therefore you should invest right now before you look back ten years later and ask yourself, &lsquo;&rdquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I start back then?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
