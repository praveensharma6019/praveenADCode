        <p class="img-fluid mb-2"><strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">La Marina Ahmedabad: Luxury living at its finest</strong></p>
        <p class="img-fluid mb-2">Ahmedabad has traditionally been a price-conscious property market, dominated by the mass and mid-segment housing, but has recently witnessed a flurry of launches in the luxury segment.&nbsp;The reason for this can be traced to the demand from non-resident Indians (NRIs) who, after being exposed to luxury living overseas, prefer the same kind of experience back home, thereby, fueling the luxury housing market in Gujarat. With&nbsp;Ahmedabad, in particular, being tipped as an emerging global city, most of the Gujarati NRIs would want to settle here.</p>
        <p class="img-fluid mb-2">
        The administrative hub of Gujarat and the 7th largest agglomeration in India, Ahmedabad is rapidly growing on the real estate map with the development of residential townships, office spaces, malls and infrastructural growth, acting as stimulators evolving its cityscape. Most modern developments- from affordable 2BHK flats in Ahmedabad to super luxury projects can be witnessed on the western side in areas like C.G. Road, Ashram Road, SG Highway, Sabarmati, Naroda, Satellite, etc. Major luxury hubs in Ahmedabad also include Thaltej, Prahlad Nagar, Vastrapur, Navrangpura and Nehru Nagar.</p>
        <p class="img-fluid mb-2">Additionally, property prices are still realistic in Ahmedabad, unlike other cities, which is a lucrative opportunity for both developers and investors. It is not only an &lsquo;investment opportunity&rsquo; city but also an &lsquo;investor friendly&rsquo; destination that has significant government support.</p>
        <p class="img-fluid mb-2">The Adani <a href="/residential-projects/shantigram-ahmedabad">township in Ahmedabad</a> called Shantigram in SG Highway is one of the most sought-after luxury projects due to its one-of-a-kind amenities like apartments overlooking a musical fountain, a skating rink and lakeside promenade. Surrounded on three sides by a 7-acre lake, residences at La Marina promise out-of-this-world serenity and beauty. It offers you a choice of fully air-conditioned <a href="/residential-projects/shantigram-ahmedabad/la-marina">4 BHK flats in Ahmedabad and 5 BHK penthouses</a>, with the latest home automation technology, so that you can preset temperature, lights and other accessories even when you are not in your apartment. Shantigram is a 580+ acre integrated modern township in Ahmedabad which aims to give people the best possible lifestyle they can imagine. Whether it is playing at international standard size cricket and football fields, indulging in retail therapy at Shoppers&rsquo; Plaza or simply enjoying the finer side of life at The Belvedere Golf and Country Club, Ahmedabad,there will always be something to engage you at Shantigram! One also has a choice of multiple schools offering CBSE and CIE education, places of worship, dedicated cycle tracks, dedicated sit-out areas, etc. thus offering every resident a wholesome living experience.</p>

        <em><strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Future Outlook of Ahmedabad&rsquo;s Luxury Real Estate</strong></em></p>
        <p class="img-fluid mb-2">Ahmedabad has the potential to emerge as one of the best luxury destinations in India, owing to ongoing and planned infrastructure projects, real estate developments,&nbsp;connectivity to other cities&nbsp;and growing industrialisation. The entry of luxury brands in the city clearly suggests that the interest level of NRI buyers in the city has been well spotted by market research.</p>
        <p class="img-fluid mb-2">Smart City Ahmedabad holds the promise of a planned city. The municipal corporation is trying to revolutionise the way it is looking at making the city smarter.&nbsp;Besides, connected civic centres, civic services across online and mobile platforms, common payment platform across transport services, widened public spaces, faster approvals for business and faster building plan approvals, green energy have found a mention in the corporation&rsquo;s planning book. And finally, Ahmedabad&rsquo;s improving connectivity with Gandhinagar could further tweak the prospects of micro-markets in the city favourably.</p>
