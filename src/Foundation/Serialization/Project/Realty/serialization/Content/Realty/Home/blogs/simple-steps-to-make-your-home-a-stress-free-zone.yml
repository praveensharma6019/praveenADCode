        A <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">stress-free home</strong> sets you free of anything that weighs you down. How do you build a serene home where you could imbibe positive energy? Below we list out a few simple steps that could rid your home of stressful energy.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        1. <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Create a great first impression</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        A clean and uncluttered home is the key. Opening the door to see overflowing clutter isn&rsquo;t good for you or your guests. Do not dump things at the door; instead, carve out small niches for all your things. For instance, a basket in the entrance area for shoes, bags etc. would be a perfect idea. The idea is basically to keep your things organized and easily accessible, but also hidden.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        2. <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Arrive in style</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The first thing you see when you enter your home must lift your spirit. It could be a series of photographs of your loved ones or a favourite painting. As you enter your home, you must be able to peacefully move over from your work life to your home life.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        3. <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Light up specific locations, not entire rooms</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Make use of various light sources. Let there be spot lighting in certain areas where brightness is needed. For example, highlighting an artwork, next to a sofa or where you read. Incorporate dimmer switches to overhead lights to create a warm ambience.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        4.<strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Structure your space</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Select your furniture wisely as per your needs. Take a minimalistic approach to decorating the shelves and tabletops.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        5. <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Add nature&rsquo;s touch</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Use soothing and natural colours like blues, greens or other calming colours that help you relax.&nbsp; For a more peaceful home, houseplants are a great option.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        6. <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Colour your world</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Simple shades are soothing, but there&rsquo;s no need to shy away from a feature wall.&nbsp; For instance, a red wall energizes your kitchen or dining room and enhances your appetite.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        7. <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Choose your Zen theme</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Adani Aangan</strong> stands for Zen. Design a space that reflects what inspires you the most in life. Structure your theme around what you love and what makes you feel very comfortable. Select elements that symbolize your passion and infuse your home with them.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Your home must be a source of restoring your energy. It should never be a place that induces stress or a reminder of unfinished tasks. Stress-free living is not about &ldquo;following the trend&rdquo; or spending money to display &ldquo;fancy embellishments&rdquo;. It is about what makes you unwind, it is absolutely subjective, and <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue"><a href="/residential-projects">Adani residential projects</a></strong> give you just that.</p>
