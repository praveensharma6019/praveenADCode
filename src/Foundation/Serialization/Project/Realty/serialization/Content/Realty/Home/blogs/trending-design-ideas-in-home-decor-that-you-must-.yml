        Home decor trends change as architects and interior designers introduce new and refreshing designs to the landscape every year. However, indoor decor is a tricky niche to deal with, as it encompasses various aspects, such as colours, tones, hues, building materials, textures, and accessories.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mb-3"><strong>Here are some of the latest trending home design ideas.</strong></h3>
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">1.  Back to nature:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
        People have an innate love for nature that is ingrained in our DNA. In 2022, one of the top <strong>home decor ideas</strong> is reconstructing a calmer environment inside the home. Many upcoming ultramodern residential apartments are designed to incorporate natural ventilation and lighting. Plants bring a visually aesthetic element to your space. In addition, make abundant use of earthy tones such as brown, beige, green, and blue.

        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">2.  Geometrical shapes from the 80s are trending again:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
        There is a growing interest and fondness among homeowners for choosing <strong>vintage interior design trends</strong>. The black and white striped rug, wall hanging, or wallpaper are back in demand. So, you could opt for geometrical shapes from the vintage 80s.

        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">3.  Trompe-l’oeil is trending as a top home design idea:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
        'Trompe-l'oeil' means deceiving the eyes. This is one beautiful move by interior designers to showcase their decor skills. This <strong>home design idea</strong> has been around for a long time but is recently enjoying a resurgence. This decor idea can be synced flawlessly in the interiors to make things more interesting and fun. For example, placing a mirror strategically in the living room makes for a fun illusion as it gives the impression of space on the other side of the mirror.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">4.  Spa-like feel to the bath:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
        As wellness is central to our lives, one key <strong>home decor trend</strong> is using coloured concrete in the bathroom. The monastic essence created is impressive, and the texture elegant.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">5.  Fancy Wooden flooring:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
        Wooden flooring is back in trend again. You can see this design element in the Hollywood movies of the ‘70s. As the new age demands sustainable options, wooden flooring is a good choice. It is easy to source, and because it has in-built thermal properties, it is a cheaper option for people living in colder regions.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid mb-2" src="-/media/Project/Realty/Blogs/Trending Design Ideas in Home Decor/Fancy-Wooden-flooring.jpg" />
        
        
        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">6.  Pattern play:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
        Recently, many real estate builders introduced pattern play as the latest home decor trend. It is heartening to see that this trend is being wholeheartedly embraced by potential home buyers looking for some dramatic effect in their abodes. Overmixing bold and large prints or using prints on walls, rugs, and patterned wallpaper bring out an element of novelty in an exciting way. It seems to touch a chord with young homebuyers who love such spectacular effects in their space.

        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">7.  Designs that accentuate the natural environment around us:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
        Another trend that is fast capturing the attention of homebuyers is design which connects us closer to nature.

        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">8.  Pinks and Purples are in:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
        Another home decor trend that is fast capturing the attention of homemakers is the colour lilac or pinkie purple. This colour is ‘in’ this season and works beautifully with the overall decor theme. The lightest shade of purple will remind you of the ‘90s when it used to be very prominent. Well, the trend has come back! It syncs perfectly well with metallic decor themes, plush velvets, mirrored themes, and more.

        <h2 class="mb-3 mt-3">9.  Curvy or chequered shapes:</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">

The lacquered trays, piped edges on bedding, curved edge trim on furniture, and scallop detailing look inspiring and exciting. Choose these undulating edges in your home decor scheme and imagine the freshness of the sea breeze coursing through your home.
