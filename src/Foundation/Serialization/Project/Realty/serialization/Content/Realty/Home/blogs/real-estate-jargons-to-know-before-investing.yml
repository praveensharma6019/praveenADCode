        <p class="mb-2">Over the last few decades, the real estate market in India has witnessed a burgeoning transition. This holds true even in the case of terminologies. Many local terms have slowly been replaced with standardized jargons.

        ">3 BHK flat in Ahmedabad</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">RERA Act &ndash; </strong>The Real Estate Regulation and Development Act (RERA) 2016 effective from 1st May 2017, is the law created to regulate the real estate sector.

        <p>
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Carpet Area  &ndash; </strong>Carpet Area is the net usable floor area of the apartment. This excludes the area covered by external walls, areas under service shafts, exclusive balcony or verandah area. However, this includes the area covered by the internal partition walls of the apartment.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Occupancy Certificate &ndash; </strong>Upon the completion of a project, it is imperative for the builder to obtain the Occupancy Certificate, certifying that the project has been completed as per the sanctioned plans and is suitable for habitation and the building has provision for civic infrastructure such as water, sanitation and electricity. It is issued by the local authorities notifying that they have provided complete clearance for occupancy and is an essential document that a homebuyer must be aware of.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">Super Built-Up Area &ndash; </strong>Besides the area occupied by individual flats, a building also features common areas such as life shafts, corridors, stairs, lobby, etc. Super Built-Up Area comprises of the built-up area along with a fair share of the common areas that have been proportionately divided among all the flats within the building.

        <strong class="mb-3 txt-d-blue">RERA Registration Number:</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-2">A RERA Registration Number is assigned to a project after its registration with the RERA authority in the state.
