        When Ahmedabad became India&rsquo;s first <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1551/" target="_blank">UNESCO World Heritage City</a>, it was a matter of pride and honour for people across the country. The startling metropolis is a bustling city in the heart of Gujarat. Since its existence, the walled city, founded by the emperor, Ahmed Shah has stood as a witness to many different episodes of India&rsquo;s history. It was here that Mahatma Gandhi began India&rsquo;s freedom struggle, and consequently, every corner is an ode to the region&rsquo;s rich legacy. While in the city, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to stumble upon fine examples of the Mughal architecture; at the same time, the mesmerising carvings in Hindu and Jain temples are enough to throw you into a trance. For its inhabitants, the rich city has so much to offer &ndash; from museums and architectural marvels to restaurants and night markets to culture and everything in between.</p>
