        Buying a house is an emotional experience &ndash; mentally, physically and financially. It involves careful deliberation and a thorough understanding of what purpose the property will be fulfilling. There is also always, a fear of what might happen if the project gets cancelled, delayed, or runs into any other complication. At <a href="https://www.adanirealty.com/">Adani Realty</a>, we too notice the trend of our completed projects like The Meadows (Shantigram), or <a href="/residential-projects/western-heights">Western Heights</a> getting far more bookings and enquiries than our under construction projects. This stems from a natural anxiety present in the consumer&rsquo;s mind because after all, investing in a home is no small thing!</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Background research is essential to a smooth purchase experience. Here are some of the more important things to consider before buying a house.</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        Make sure the builders are the rightful owners of the land and that they have taken all necessary approvals from the respective municipal and /or other bodies required, for construction on the plot. Any discrepancy here can result in litigation and endless delays in completion of the project.</p>

        Check the previous track record of the builder, to see if their previous projects have been completed on time. Many builders make a habit out of pushing their delivery schedules endlessly. Of course such a risk is not implied when you purchase an existing property, but completed properties are also a lot more expensive, so if you&rsquo;re on a budget, then an under construction property is a better option for you.</p>

        What is the point of owning a luxurious apartment that is totally isolated and has no proximity to the facilities you will regularly require? Always take note of everything around a property when inspecting it. Are there schools and hospitals nearby? What about grocers, restaurants and transit points like stations and bus stops?</p>

        When you are spending so much money on a new home, it may as well offer you more than four walls and a ceiling. Opt for projects that have at least some lifestyle amenities that will make your life happier and healthier. Playgrounds, Sports and Fitness facilities, Swimming Pools and Spa Houses are just a few of the add-on amenities that builders are offering nowadays.</p>
