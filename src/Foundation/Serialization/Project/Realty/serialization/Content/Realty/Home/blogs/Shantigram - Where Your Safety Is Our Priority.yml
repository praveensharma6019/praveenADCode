        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><em>&ldquo;I believe in being strong when everything seems to be going wrong. I believe that tomorrow is another day and I believe in miracles.&rdquo; - Audrey Hepburn</em></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Resilience. If there is one word that the past year has taught us, one lesson that we carry forward with us for the rest of our lives, it&rsquo;s resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic has tested all of us at Shantigram but it has also brought us several blessings. It has taught us to place health and well-being above all, to rely on each other, and to come up with safety measures and guidelines that will keep us and our families in good shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Understanding Micro Containment&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>To begin with, it is important to understand that while The Meadows and Elysium have been currently designated micro containment zones, all of Shantigram is NOT a containment area.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>What&rsquo;s the difference?</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Small areas where many COVID-19 cases have been reported are designated as micro-containment zones. These are different from containment zones because the latter comes with severe restrictions on the residents. In the Medows and Elysium, the restrictions are largely self-imposed and not as severe as in containment areas. Medical supplies, groceries, and essentials are all permitted with appropriate health checks for those delivering these.</span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Shantigram is much more than a new flat scheme in Ahmedabad. It is a community, one large family. <a href="/residential-projects/shantigram-ahmedabad" target="_blank">Adani Shantigram</a>&rsquo;s commitment to its residents stands strong and the measures taken by us to keep our community safe are sure to boost your confidence.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><strong><span>Safety and Health &ndash; Together We Can</span></strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span>Shantigram is also one of the greenest <a href="/residential-projects/shantigram-ahmedabad" target="_blank">residential projects in Ahmedabad</a>. The natural ventilation, expansive green spaces, great sunlight, and beautiful views support mental health and happiness. We aim to create a nurturing community that will work together for the health and safety of its residents. Containing the spread of the pandemic and caring for those affected are indeed short-term goals but the larger endeavour is to build a space that is an environment of trust and joy for the homeowners.</span></p>
