        There is a steadily growing community of retirees today, who are opting to move to peaceful, less polluted areas that offer all the comforts of home, along with the security of an assisted facility and the comfort and companionship of living alongside other seniors.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Afterall, we all earn for a good livelihood. For a life that we deserve. To provide ourselves with the comfort that we need. And most importantly to save for our old age that we trust with no one but ourselves. Along with passing age, our lives slow down too. As our age progresses, we yearn for a life that is simple and uncomplicated. We yearn to live around people alike. To live a life stress-free and without any troubles.We all dream of having a senior-citizen home where we can finally settle down in the latter days of our life. Catering to these needs, a lot of real estate developers are coming up with the concept of senior citizen homes and senior citizen housing projects that are stand-alone projects or a part of larger integrated townships.</p>

        From medically trained staff on call, to staff doctors, infirmaries and in-house ambulances, these new age retirement homes leave no stone unturned to ensure the safety of their residents.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Residents are encouraged to come together as a community, and keep themselves physically active and mentally engaged in their areas of interest, so as to prevent boredom related psychological symptoms from setting in, as is frequent with many retirees..</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        All day-to-day concerns like plumbers, electricians, cooks etc., are taken care of by the facility, so that seniors can finally lead the hassle free life they deserve after all their years of hard work and stress. There are also in-house cafeterias where residents can opt to eat their meals together if they so wish. Annual or monthly maintenance fees take care of all these services and more. These senior citizen housing projects look after every small need of the residents ensuring a comfortable life for them.</p>

        ">The Belvedere Golf and Country Club</a>, besides all the other usual facilities.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Retirement homes like these are not to be confused with old-age homes where seniors live in a room as a patient. Here, seniors own their own homes within the complex, and yet, receive all the care and facilities that they could possible need and want. Seniors find this a great arrangement as they have all the freedom to live as they want, without having to feel like guests in their married children&rsquo;s homes. Many people who currently live in senior communities swear by it, saying that the joy of having people your own age for companionship is unparalleled. It&rsquo;s no wonder then that Retirement Homes are getting known as the best retirement plan for one&rsquo;s old age!</p>
