        The Union Budget 2017 looks set to have a fairly dramatic impact on the housing sector. Giving a major boost to the &lsquo;Housing For All by 2022&rsquo; campaign, the Union Budget 2017 released by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, bestowed the budget housing sector with &lsquo;infrastructure status&rsquo;. The announcement is bound to boost investment by private players. The involvement of private players will in turn lead to competition, which would then end up providing more options for the middle and lower-middle classes aiming to buy their first homes.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        The&nbsp;real estate sector contributes approximately 15 per cent of India&rsquo;s GDP; yet it still doesn&rsquo;t have an official industry status. Experts have consistently been asking the government to grant it &lsquo;industry status&rsquo;. Since the real estate sector is not included among the categories of industry, developers, builders and investors are often compelled to avail loans at higher rate of interests. Due to the high interest rate on loans, builders always face a shortage of funds. The end result? Delayed completion of projects, and irate consumers.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Regarding the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), the government announced that an interest rate of only 4 per cent would be charged on loans above Rs. 9 lakh, and 3 per cent on loans above Rs. 12 lakh.&nbsp;</p>
        <!-- <p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">Home sales in India's top eight cities grew 9% in the quarter to June compared to that a year ago, marking the third straight quarter of expansion and indicating green shoots in a market emerging from a prolonged downturn, according to property research firm Liases Foras.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The growth was led by cities including Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where home sales went up 20%. The national capital region, which includes the large markets of Gurgaon and Noida, saw a 12% increase in home sales while Mumbai recorded a modest 2% growth.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Pune, Chennai and Bengaluru witnessed sales decline by 8%, 4% and 3% respectively.</p>
        								<p class="resi_text1" style="color:#2B3E5F;margin-bottom:0px!important;text-align: justify;">The weighted average price during the quarter increased 4% year-on-year to Rs 6,660 per sq ft, with the maximum increase reported in Ahmedabad at 11%, while Chennai reported 8% and Hyderabad 6%. The Mumbai market saw prices remain flat while NCR saw a drop of 3%.</p> -->

        The new Budget is offering builders a one-year tax break upon getting the completion certificate, allowing them time to sell stock, and reducing litigation on notional income from such assets. Buyers are exempt from long-term capital gains tax if they sell property after 2 years.</p>
