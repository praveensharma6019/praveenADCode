        								   <h4>Largest Private Sector Power Player of India</h4>
        								   <p>
        								   </p><p><strong>Powering the lives of millions across India</strong></p>
        								   <p>Powering the lives of millions across India, Adani is the largest player with eight plants in thermal and renewable power as well as transmission assets.</p>
        								   <p>India’s nationalised enterprises have struggled to meet the rising energy demands. Estimates suggest that by 2020, the private sector will account for 40% of the electricity generated and Adani is set to play a vital role in this scenario. Adani is the largest private thermal power producer with 10,440 MW, the largest private power transmission company with over 8,500 kms of transmission network and one of the largest renewables players in the country with strong footprints in Solar Power generation, Solar equipment manufacturing as well as Wind Power generation.</p>
        								   <p>The Group is now committed to set up an additional 10,000 MW of renewable power generation capacity of which we already have about 2.5 GW completed or under execution including the world’s largest single location solar power plant of 648 MW.</p>
