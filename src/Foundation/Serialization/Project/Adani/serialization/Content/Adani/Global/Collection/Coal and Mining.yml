        <p class="d-block mb-3">The road to empowerment is the one that guards a country&rsquo;s stride onwards, keeping every hurdle that poses a threat to the constant pace of progress at bay. Yet another milestone in our growth story, is the business of Natural Resources. The scale of our business assures a steady availability of coal, extracted in the most responsible ways, which promises constant supply of power to both urban and rural geographies of India ensuring no hurdles are faced by the citizens in the path to achieving their dreams. The mining industry is considered a major contributor to the growth of the Indian economy. The mining business unit of the Adani group was established in 2007 as the last link in ensuring energy security for India. We are also developing and operating mines in Indonesia and Australia.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="d-none mb-3">In the past few years, we have transformed from a coal trading and importing company to a comprehensive integrated coal management company. We have a diversified trading portfolio and are involved in Coal and Coke trading. </p>
