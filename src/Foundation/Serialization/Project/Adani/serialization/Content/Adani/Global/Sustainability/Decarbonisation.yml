        <p class="mb-1 pl-4  d-block">Adani portfolio companies, namely Adani Transmission Limited, Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited, and Adani Green Energy Limited, are deeply committed to the decarbonisation of power generation and to bringing green electricity to Mumbaikars and other customers committed to sourcing green electrons.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 pl-4  d-block">Adani utility companies have already implemented:</p>
        <p class="mb-1 pl-5  d-block">(a) Green Power Infrastructure, including a 1,690MW project in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan with a capital outlay of USD ~1.8bn fully funded by a combination of 12 international banks and the internal resources of AGEL. </p>
        <p class="mb-1 pl-5  d-block">(b) Green Transmission Infrastructure, including transmission lines that enable the supply of green power to the city of Mumbai and all other bulk consumptive centres. The capital outlay of ~USD 1.5bn has been funded by eight international banks as well as AGEL. </p>
        <p class="mb-2 pl-5  d-block">(c) Green Distribution Infrastructure, including a capex program to ensure the higher reliability of power in Mumbai, with a capital outlay of ~USD 3bn funded through a mix of a USD 2bn Global Medium Term Note program and the internal resources of AEML.</p>
        <p class="mb-1 pl-4  d-block">In total, this translates to USD 6.3bn already invested in greening the Mumbai power mix.</p>
        <p class="mb-1 pl-4  d-block">AGEL has also recently completed the acquisition of SB Energy, a 5 GW renewable portfolio in India with a capex outlay of USD 3.5bn and the Adani Group has also made green hydrogen ecosystem investments to the tune of USD 2.5bn</p>
        <p class="mb-3 pl-4  d-block">Through our utilities portfolio, we have already invested USD 12.3bn out of the USD 70bn we have pledged to invest in green technologies over the next decade.</p>
