        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are aware of baseless rumours being spread on social media that the process of grain collection in Punjab &amp; Haryana is being manipulated to
        benefit the Adani Group.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, these grain silos function as mandis. By connecting farmers with these silos, Food Corporation of India (FCI)
        is working to cut costs on gunny bags, grain handling and its transportation, and also reduce the grain wastage caused by repeated handling of
        gunny bags at several points. Highly efficient silo technology improves the grain collection process, which also means that farmers save a lot of
        time as their transaction is completed in just a couple of hours. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">It is unfortunate to see a pro-farmer decision that strengthens our nation&rsquo;s food security being twisted
        into a malicious narrative against
        the Adani Group.</p>
