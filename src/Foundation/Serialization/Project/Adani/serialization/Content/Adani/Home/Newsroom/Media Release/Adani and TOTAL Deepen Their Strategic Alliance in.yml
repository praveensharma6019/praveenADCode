TOTAL and Adani agreed the acquisition of a 50% stake in a 2.35 GWac portfolio of operating solar assets owned by AGEL and a 20% stake in AGEL for a global investment of USD 2.5 Billion. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #212529;">India has set a policy target of setting up 450 GW of renewable power capacity by 2030, driven by the vision, spirit and leadership of Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Starting with Prime Minister Modi&rsquo;s commitment in the Paris Agreement in 2015 and further reinforcement in 2019 United Nation Climate Action Summit, India has been in the forefront of the global agenda of fight against climate change. In this context, Adani Group and TOTAL have joined hands to develop green power sources at affordable prices and to deliver this transformational energy solution. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #212529;">AGEL, started in 2015 with the world&rsquo;s largest single location solar power project located in Kamuthi, Tamil Nadu (648 MW) has come a long way to be ranked as the #1 global solar power generation asset developer by Mercom Capital. As on date, AGEL has over 14.6 GW of contracted renewable capacity, with an operating capacity of 3 GW and another 3 GW under construction and 8.6 GW under development. The company aims to achieve 25 GW of renewable power generation by 2025 and is committed to contribute meaningfully to India&rsquo;s COP21 goals and to the wider UNFCC goals of sustainability. </span></p>
