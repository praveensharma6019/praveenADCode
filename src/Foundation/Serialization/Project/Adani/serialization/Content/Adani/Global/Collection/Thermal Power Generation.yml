        <p class="d-block mb-3">Power lights up our houses and lives. It brightens futures, not just of individuals but of communities at large, thereby creating a growth story that ramifies throughout the country. India’s nationalised enterprises have struggled to meet the rising energy demands, chocking dreams to darkness. As the largest thermal private power player, Adani is on a mission to help India become self-reliant in power generation.</p>
        <p class="d-none mb-3">Adani's thermal power portfolio comprises 12,410 MW. This includes a power plant each in Mundra (Gujarat), Tiroda (Maharashtra), Kawai (Rajasthan), Udupi (Karnataka) and, Korba and Raikheda (Chhattisgarh). This makes the company India’s largest private sector power player. The power generated here is witnessing businesses grow, literacy rise and livelihood flourish.</p>
