We are delighted to spearhead national initiatives like the #iCan School Challenge. I believe such competitions will encourage our young change agents to think deeply about how best they can secure their future and that of the nation.” </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">“We saw a lot of young leaders of today. Every young kid brings to the table something which helps in nation building”, said jury member <strong>Adv Afroz Shah.</strong> </p>
