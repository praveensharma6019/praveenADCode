        <div class="col-lg-11">
        <p class="mb-3">The Adani Group Chairman, Gautam Adani on December 7, presented yet another insightful glimpse of defining transformations set to redefine the way energy would be produced and consumed in the world.
        
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Citing rampant technology-driven disruption in every walk of life, the first generation entrepreneur said that the energy market, in particular, is likely to see massive disruptions with the emergence of new business models and history will remember this time as the transformative era for the energy business.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">“I expect the disruption in the energy markets will create over a trillion-dollar of value over the next two decades - and even more importantly - lay the foundation of “hope” to the millions that have lived their lives lacking electricity,” he said.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-3">Adani who is viewed as one of the global thought leaders on clean energy transition and visionary entrepreneurship told the informed forum that imminent disruptions are more disruptive than the era of the steam engine. Reinstating his strong belief on renewables, he pointed out that green energy solutions demonstrate economies of scale on a centralized and decentralized basis with the shrinking differentiation between the producer and consumer.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">According to the Adani Group founder, a new disruptive energy architecture is taking shape with the electrification of mobility, various forms of battery chemistries, artificial intelligence-based demand response systems, and extreme levels of digitization.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">“Just as the steam engine gave the world the foundation to efficiently convert the energy of coal into useful mechanical power, renewable energy is giving the world the means to efficiently electrify almost every known process and India is leading the world through its ability to perhaps produce the least expensive electrons mankind has yet known,” he said.</p>

        <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
        
        <p class="mb-3">Speaking to a distinguished audience of global startups, business leaders, investors, innovation community, and ecosystem players, Adani invoked upon the historic words spoken by Former French President François Hollande and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s at the 2015 COP 21 Summit. He said that the launch of the International Solar Alliance was unprecedented as it united 121 nations for a common purpose. The self-made entrepreneur reemphasized upon his home country India’s leading role in this transformation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
        
        <p class="mb-3">“India’s approach was validated by a very recent BNEF Climatescope study that ranked it as the top emerging market for clean energy, well on its way to meet its goal of 450 GW of clean energy by 2030. The acceleration is unprecedented - As of today, India is already approaching 100 GW of renewable capacity with another 80 GW under construction or tendered out. In fact, India is the ONLY G20 nation whose actions have allowed it to keep its promised rate of decarbonization.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p class="mb-3">Driven by the philosophy of nation-building, Adani, said that the integrated infrastructure organisation founded by him was playing a significant role in contributing to India’s climate goals. Despite being just a 5-years-old company, the group’s renewables business is all set to become the world’s largest renewables company with 25GW capacity by 2030, he added humbly.
        
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p class="mb-3">“In closing, let me re-emphasize – India’s importance to the world’s green energy revolution and its market size is unmatched. Yes, it is competitive - yet it attracted a massive 64 billion dollars of foreign investment over the past 4 years. What personally makes it exciting is the opportunity to participate in this journey and showcase that the Adani Group can establish one of the fastest rates of decarbonization ever witnessed.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p class="mb-3">Mr. Gautam Adani then took the audience on a virtual tour of the Adani Group’s journey, its contribution to nation-building, Indian economy and its overarching philosophy of Growth with Goodness.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">“We basically build infrastructure that enables “flow”. The the flow of goods and materials, the flow of electrons, the flow of people, and the flow of data. This focus on helping build India’s infrastructure forms the core of our “Nation Building” philosophy,” said the man reminiscing a 30 year+ legacy.
        </p>
        </div>
        <!--<div class="col-lg-12">
        <p class="mb-3">This vision to build India, enabled the Adani Group, to enter sectors facing critical demand gaps and growth through expansion into adjacent sectors. Its incubation model of nurturing new businesses within the flagship company, Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) led to the creation of 6 publicly-traded companies which created thousands of jobs and delivered unprecedented value to its shareholders.</p>
        <p class="mb-3"><b>“A one-rupee investment in Adani Enterprises, that was our the first IPO in 1994, has returned over 800X,” he said.</b></p>
        <p class="mb-3">From emerging as a market leader across its various businesses of thermal power, renewables. Ports & logistics, gas distribution to foraying into new sectors aligned to new India’s needs such as Airports, Aerospace & Defence and Data Centres, Mr. Adani said that his group has built India’s largest infrastructure business that is now manifesting itself as an integrated “platform of platforms”. “This platform helps us bridge the B2B to B2C gap in unique ways and provide to India its largest physical “Infrastructure as a Service” platform.”</p>
        <p class="mb-3">The talk concluded on the most optimistic note. He said, that every crisis helps the world build its own level of immunity and it emerges stronger on the other side.
        
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">“For the sake of the fans of the GDP metric – let’s look at some statistics. The global GDP in 1990 was $38 trillion. Today, 30 years later, this number is $90 trillion. Projecting out another 30 years in 2050 the global GDP is expected to be about $170 trillion with India has become the second-largest economy in the world.”

        <p class="mb-3">Adani Agri Fresh Limited has created state-of-the-art Controlled Atmosphere (CA) facilities of 22636 MT capacity in the apple growing belts of Shimla district in HP. The CA facilities are located at Bithal (near Rampur), Sainj (near Theog) and Mehandli (Rohru). The company has created these CA facilities with fully automated sorting, grading & packing lines along with refrigerated vans to maintain the cold chain from CA store to market. The growers have an easy access to these facilities and thereby reduce significant post-harvest losses.
        
        What began as a small intervention to build India from its roots has today grown into a massive movement empowering more than 17000 small and marginal apple farmers.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">As a part of the Adani Agri Fresh’s farm-to-market infrastructure, the teams work with farmers from the pre-harvest season till the finish goods are delivered to the last mile. This includes high quality crop care inputs by a panel of renowned scientists, field level training, growers’ meet to impart knowledge, harvesting, soil testing etc.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Today apples produced by humble and hardworking people like Narveer Thakur reach millions of homes across more than 50 Indian cities.</p>
