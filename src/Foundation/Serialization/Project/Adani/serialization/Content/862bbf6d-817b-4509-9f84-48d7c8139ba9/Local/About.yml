        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ahmedabad, October 14, 2019:</strong> Adani and TOTAL have signed definitive agreements to deepen their existing partnership and commitment for developing multi-energy offerings to the Indian energy market. </p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">City Gas Distribution is a natural extension of the plans of both partners to invest in infrastructure and assets worth over US$1 billion, which span Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure and marketing and fuel retail business, announced in October 2018.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This demonstrates both partners&rsquo; commitment to this important partnership and confidence in Adani Gas as the leading gas distribution player and commitment to the Government&rsquo;s vision to provide benefits of piped natural gas and CNG to 70% populations of the country. </p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 mb-2">Transaction Details </h5>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
        Total will purchase 37.4% shares in Adani Gas Limited through a tender offer to public shareholders to acquire up to 25.2% shares subject to applicable regulations and purchase the residual shares from Adani Family. </p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
        Adani Family and TOTAL SA shareholders shall ultimately hold 37.4% each and public shareholders shall hold remaining 25.2%. </p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">

        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
        Adani Gas shall also pursue fuel retail business in India and target to setup 1,500 fuel stations offering top of the line products in the coming years.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
        This strategic partnership expansion will create:</p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 mb-2">Among the Largest Downstream Energy businesses in India</h5>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
        Adani, the largest infrastructure conglomerate in India, and TOTAL, the world&rsquo;s second largest LNG private player, will serve the fast growing gas demand of the Indian market.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
        The expanded partnership will develop regasification terminals including Dhamra LNG, on the East coast of India; market LNG to the Indian markets and through Adani Gas, target to distribute gas to 7.5% of India&rsquo;s population. This strengthens the partners&rsquo; commitment to make big stride towards India&rsquo;s vision of promotion of natural gas and clean energy mix.</p>
        <h5>Multi-Billion Dollar Commitment to a Pan India Platform integrated Gas utility</h5>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Both partners would make significant investments in the next 10 years across the businesses to develop India&rsquo;s gas infrastructure, distribution, marketing businesses with presence in over 15 states reaching out to approximately 7.5% of India&rsquo;s population and setting up global scale and world class LNG, gas distribution and fuel retail infrastructure in India</p>
        <h5 class="mt-5 mb-2">Complementary Portfolio of Fuel Retail and Gas Distribution Network </h5>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">As part of the existing Joint Venture, Adani and Total in the coming years will target to build a fuel retail network of 1,500 retail stations, on the main roads of the country, such as highways and intercity connections. </p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Adani Gas will also be setting up 1,500 CNG stations for gas distribution over the next 10 years in its and its joint ventures&rsquo; geographical areas across 71 districts, 68 towns across 15 states in India. </p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Adani Gas and its joint venture will distribute gas to 6 million households in the next decade. Adani Gas CNG network will be developed exploring synergies including co-location of fuel retail and CNG outlets. </p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Both businesses would have significant complementarities by providing unique portfolio of multi product services including gas where Adani Gas Limited has exclusive marketing rights. These offerings are in line with international standards that will also include Total&rsquo;s product range.</p>
        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Speaking on the occasion, Adani Group Chairman, Mr. Gautam Adani, said, </strong>&ldquo;Adani is delighted to deepen its strategic partnership with Total, a global energy major, to one of the largest downstream gas partnerships in India. Total&rsquo;s investment in Adani Gas reinforces India&rsquo;s natural gas and demand potential. The partnership will derive significant synergies between Adani&rsquo;s capabilities of developing world-class assets and Total&rsquo;s global best practices as well as leveraging business synergies across LNG, Fuel Retail and City Gas distribution. We look forward to working together towards delivering India&rsquo;s vision for clean and green energy&rdquo;</p>
