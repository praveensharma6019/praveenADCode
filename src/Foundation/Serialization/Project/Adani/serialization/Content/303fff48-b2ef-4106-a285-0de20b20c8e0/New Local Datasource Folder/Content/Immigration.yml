        <p>Immigration checks are conducted for all passengers, Indians or foreigners, both at the time of arrival and departure. The passports are duly stamped at the time of arrival as well as departure. Passengers should be careful to see that their passports are duly stamped before leaving the immigration counter. Passengers are required to present valid travel documents i.e. passport and visa (if applicable) before proceeding for immigration clearance. </p>
