        •	How do I get to the airport on public transport?<br>
        o	At present there is NO public transport available for the Airport from the city, however the airport is well connected with regards to Prepaid Taxi Service, OLA & UBER and Auto services.</br><br>
        
        •	I want to pick someone up from and drop someone to the Airport. Which is the best place to wait or park?</br>
        o	The drop and pickup zone are available in front of the terminal on the departure as well as arrivals. These can be used to pick up or drop off passengers free of charge. However, there is a charge for parking the vehicle in the parking zone.<br />
