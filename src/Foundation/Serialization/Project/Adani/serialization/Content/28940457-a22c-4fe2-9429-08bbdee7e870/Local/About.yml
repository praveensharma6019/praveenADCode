            <li>Consolidated Total Income for the quarter increased by 39% to Rs 5,784 crore compared to Rs 4,175 crore in corresponding prior year quarter due to increased number of power units sold.</li>
            <li>Consolidated EBIDTA for the quarter increased by 47% to Rs 1,824 crore compared Rs 1,243 crore in in corresponding prior year quarter. EBIDTA impact of demerger of transmission business was more than compensated by lower cost and improved operational efficiencies achieved at all plants.</li>

            <li>Depreciation charged during the second quarter is Rs 588 crores and is not comparable with corresponding quarter of previous year as the company had given the impact of Schedule-II of the Companies Act, 2013.</li>
            <li>Interest expenses during the quarter increased to Rs 1,605 crores due to one-time impact of Rs 98 crores towards prepayment penalty charges paid for refinancing of loans. Refinancing of Rupee loans would reduce the interest costs going forward.</li>
            <li>Consolidated Net Loss for the quarter has reduced to Rs 369 crore as against Rs 799 crores in the corresponding prior year quarter.</li>
