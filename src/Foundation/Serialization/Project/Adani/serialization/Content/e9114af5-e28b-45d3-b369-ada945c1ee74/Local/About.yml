Also, as one of the top five renewable energy companies in the world, our ability to power our data centers with solar and wind energy is unique and addresses some of the challenges of building and operating data centers. We are excited about partnering with Digital Realty, the world’s market leader in the data center industry, to help with the transformation of this sector in India. The skill sets of the two companies are complementary, and together we can provide unmatched products and solutions to customers in India.” </p>

The Adani Group’s understanding of real estate development, energy, cooling technologies and access to connectivity across the nation will be critical to providing a world-class experience to a customer base that sees India as one of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world. We are strongly committed to working with Adani to build out a world-class data center network in India to support the growth of our global and Indian customers.”  </p>
