        o<span> </span>Most airlines allow passengers with disabilities to take their wheelchairs with them. However, you should inform the airline about this when you book your ticket. If you have a battery-powered wheelchair, the battery must be disconnected, and the battery terminals prevented from short-circuiting when you check the wheelchair in. You should report first of all to the check-in desk at the airport.</p>
