        <p class="txt-sm mb-3">I travel across India and have stayed at various hotels. But the stay at Belvedere Club has been the best so far. Hotel Room – Each and every item in the room is of finest quality, everything is so carefully chosen for the customers delight. Rooms are very spacious, lightings are fully automated. I must tell the quality is even better than 5 star hotels. Restaurant and Food – They give attention to the minute details of food and cutlery and extremely clean, the quality and food taste is of very high end hotel at a reasonable price. Everything is so well managed that you don’t have to look for anyone’s service.</p>
