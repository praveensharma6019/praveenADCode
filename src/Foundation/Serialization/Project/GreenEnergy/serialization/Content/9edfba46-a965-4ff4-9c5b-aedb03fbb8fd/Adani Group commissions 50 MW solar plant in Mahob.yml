               <p><strong>Ahmedabad, June 13, 2017 :</strong> Adani Group, a global integrated infrastructure conglomerate, today announced commissioning of 50 MW solar PV plant in Mahoba, Uttar Pradesh, under the National Solar Mission Scheme, with an investment of Rs. 315 cr.</p>
                  <br /><p>The technology used for setting up this plant includes String Inverter Technology which is 1st of its kind in UP with crystalline silicon modules that allows miniature level control of solar power generation. The transmission line runs up to a stretch of 21.5 km. The power generated by this plant will be evacuated by 132 kv transmission line to UPTCL, Mahoba Substation under agreement signed with NTPC. Indirect and direct employment opportunities were created for a total of around 250 personnel, who worked diligently to achieve this feat, and employment opportunities will be provided through the generation period as well.</p>
                  <br /><p>“We are delighted to have achieved the setting up of this plant, helping us prove our dedicated efforts towards nation building as well as showing our commitment to the government’s green energy mission. We are moving closer to our aim of revolutionizing the renewable energy sector in India.We would like to extend our heartiest gratitude to the UP government officials for their support and playing a huge role in helping us achieve the smooth commissioning of this plant,” <strong>said Mr. Jayant Parimal, CEO, Renewable Energy Business, Adani Group.</strong> </p>
