        <p><strong>Ahmedabad, 21 March 2022:  </strong> , Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL) has extended its Construction Financing Framework to USD 1.64 Bn
        by raising a USD 288 Mn facility for its under-construction renewable asset portfolio through definitive agreements signed with a group of leading
        international lenders. The facility will initially finance the 450 MW hybrid portfolio of solar and wind renewable projects that AGEL is setting up
        in Rajasthan, India. In March 2021, AGEL had closed a USD 1.35 Bn construction revolver facility in one of Asia&rsquo;s largest project financing deals.</p>
        <br />
        <p>According to the definitive agreements, 7 international banks &ndash; BNP Paribas, Co&ouml;peratieve Rabobank U.A., Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., MUFG Bank, Ltd.,
        Societe Generale, Standard Chartered Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation &ndash; committed for the facility which is a certified green hybrid project
        loan. The extended pool of liquidity strengthens AGEL&rsquo;s strategy to fast-track the development of its under-construction asset portfolio in sync with
        accelerating the energy transition.</p>
        <br />
        <p>&ldquo;The construction facility is the key ingredient of AGEL&rsquo;s capital management plan, enabling us to deliver on our focus on decarbonizing power generation&rdquo;
        said <strong> Mr Vneet S Jaain, MD &amp; CEO, AGEL.</strong> &ldquo;We are committed to sustainable growth and to catalyzing energy transition. AGEL has set a target of achieving
        45 GW renewable energy capacity by 2030, representing 10% of the Govt of India&rsquo;s 450GW countrywide renewable energy target. Our development agenda is
        in sync with overall capital stewardship maintained through our capital management philosophy focused on sustainable growth.&rdquo; </p>
