        <p style="margin: 0in -16.5pt 8pt -28.35pt; text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="background: white; color: #212529;">Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Group, said:</span></strong><span style="background: white; color: #212529;">&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span style="color: black;">This acquisition is another step towards the vision we stated in January 2020, wherein we laid out our plans to become the world&rsquo;s largest solar player by 2025 and thereafter the world&rsquo;s largest renewable company by 2030. India, without any doubt, has been one of the few nations that has accelerated its global commitment towards climate change and we intend to do our part to execute on the promises made. The renewable energy platform that we are building will lay the foundation for attracting several other global industries that are increasingly looking to reduce their carbon footprint (as well as lay the foundation for opening up adjacent platforms that include Hydrogen and Storage). We are well on our way to achieve our stated solar portfolio targets four years before the deadline we set for ourselves. The quality of assets that SoftBank and the Bharti Group have built are excellent and I compliment their efforts to support India&rsquo;s renewable energy transition. We are proud to take their legacy forward.&rdquo; </span></p>

We are immensely proud of all that we have accomplished. As SBG continues our transition to a global investment holding company focused on accelerating the deployment of artificial intelligence, we believe now is the right time to bring in the Adani Group to help drive the next phase of SB Energy India&rsquo;s growth.&rdquo;</span></strong><strong></strong></p>
