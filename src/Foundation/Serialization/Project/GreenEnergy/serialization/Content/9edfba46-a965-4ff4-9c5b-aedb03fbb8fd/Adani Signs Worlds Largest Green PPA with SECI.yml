        <p><strong>Ahmedabad, 14 December 2021: </strong> Adani Green Energy Ltd (AGEL), the world’s largest solar power developer and the renewable energy arm of the diversified Adani Group, has signed an agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to supply 4,667 MW of green power. This is the world’s largest ever green power purchase agreement. </p>
        <br />
        <p>"We are pleased to have signed the world’s largest PPA with SECI," said <strong>Mr Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group</strong>. "This is yet another step in our journey to enable India's dual objective to accelerate India’s renewable energy footprint as well as promote domestic manufacturing under the <strong>Atmanirbhar Bharat</strong> programme. Following the proceedings at COP 26, it is increasingly evident that the world has to equitably transition to a low carbon economy faster than previously anticipated. This is why the Adani Group has committed US$50-$70 Bn of investment in the renewables space. This agreement keeps us well on track to our commitment to become the world’s largest renewables player by 2030."</p>
        <br />
        <p>The AGEL-SECI agreement to supply 4,667 MW is part of a manufacturing-linked solar tender of 8,000 MW awarded to AGEL by SECI in June 2020, which set a record for being the world’s largest solar development tender ever awarded. </p>
        <br />
        <p />So far, AGEL has signed PPAs with SECI for a total generation capacity of close to 6000 MW of the 8,000 MW awarded in 2020. AGEL expects to close the balance 2000 MW PPA in the next two to three months.<p />
