              <p><strong>Ahmedabad/Bhatinda, November 8 2016 :</strong> Adani Enterprises Ltd, part of the Adani Group, a globally integrated infrastructure player, today inaugurated Punjab’s largest solar power plant of 100 megawatts (MW) at Sardargarh &amp; Chughe Kalan, Bhatinda, with an investment of around Rs 640 crore, set by its subsidiary Adani Green Energy Ltd.</p>
                  <br /><p>The ceremony was attended by Hon’ble Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab, Mr. Sukhbir Singh Badal, amongst other senior officials from the state.</p>
                  <br /><p>The Company is using top notch technology to set up the entire 100 MW solar plant project which has started commissioning almost six months ahead of schedule. Indirect and direct employment opportunities were created for a total of around 300-400 personnel, who worked diligently to achieve this feat ahead of its time.</p>
                 <br /> <p>“We are delighted to have added yet another feather in our cap with the setting up of this plant, helping us prove our dedicated efforts towards nation building. We are moving closer to our aim of revolutionizing the renewable energy sector in India. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Hon’ble Deputy Chief Minister and the government of Punjab, present here today, for their endless support and playing a huge role in helping us achieve this enormous feat,” said Mr Jayant Parimal, CEO, Renewable Energy Business, Adani Group.</p>
                 <br /> <p>The solar plant is not only the largest project in Punjab but will also prove to be the largest tracker-based solar project in the country. The technology used for setting up this plant includes Poly Crystalline Silicon PV Modules and Horizontal Single Axis Tracker (HSAT). This plant will be India’s biggest HSAT plant at a single location. The plant spreads over approximately 641 acres of land with the evacuation of 132 kV Balluana Substation through Double circuit 132 KV transmission line. The annual energy yield is expected to be approximately 88,000 Mwh/ annum.</p>
                  <br /><p>The Adani Group is currently the leader in Solar Power generation in the country. Apart from the 100 MW Solar Power Plant in Bhatinda, the company also has a 40 MW solar plant at Bitta, Gujarat and has also recently unveiled a 648 MW solar power project at Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu which is the world’s largest solar power plant in a single location. Moreover the company has also signed a JV with the Rajasthan government to develop the country's largest solar park in the state with 10,000 MW capacity.</p>
