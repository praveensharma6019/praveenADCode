        <br /><p><b>Revenues</b></p>
        <p>Total Revenue for Q1 was up by 40% to ₹ 661 crore from ₹ 472 crore y-o-y </p>
        <br /><p>Revenue from Power generation for Q1 up by 17% to ₹ 554 crore from ₹ 472 crore y-o-y on account of full period operationalisation and additional project commissioning. The total number of units’ sold5 in Q1 was 1,118 Mu’s up 15% y-o-y. The revenue for Q1’2020 and Q1’2019 is after adjusting discount on prompt payments by off-takers of ₹ 9 crore and ₹ 3 crore respectively.</p>
        <br /><p><b>EBITDA and EBITDA Margins </b></p>
        <p>EBITDA1 for Q1 at ₹ 496 crore was up 13% on account of increased operating capacity. </p>
        <br /><p>EBITDA margin2 during the quarter was at 90% compared to 93% y-o-y.</p>
        <br /><p><b>Depreciation and Amortization</b></p>
        <p>Depreciation was at ₹ 248 crore, higher by 9% y-o-y on account of full period impact of projects capitalized in Q4 of FY’2019 and additional project commissioning.
        The Group follows Written down value (WDV) method of depreciation. The depreciation based on Straight-line method would have been ₹ 102 crore in Q1 FY2020, ₹ 84 crore in Q1 FY2019 and ₹ 110 crore in Q4 2019
        </p>
        <br /><p><b>Finance Cost and other income </b></p>
        <p>Interest and other borrowing cost during the quarter was ₹ 250 crore, up by ₹ 57 crore primarily on account of charging of interest to profit and loss account as compared to capitalization of interest in previous quarters being in project phases and additional debt on account of ramp up of capacity.</p>
        <br /><p>Other income was up by ₹ 4 crore primarily due to interest income on deposits and income from Mutual funds investment.</p>
        <br /><p><b>Exceptional items</b></p>
        <p>During the current quarter, the Group has refinanced its earlier borrowings of ₹ 5,844 crore, through issuance of secured senior notes (US$ denominated bonds) and rupee term loans from a bank and financial Institutions. On account of such refinancing activities, the Group has incurred a onetime expense aggregating to ₹ 98.41 Crore which comprises of prepayment charges, unamortized portion of other borrowing cost related to earlier borrowings and cost of premature termination of derivative contracts. </p>
        <br /><p><b>Loss after tax and Cash Profit</b></p>
        <p>Loss after tax for the quarter was ₹ 77 Crore.</p>
        <br /><p>Cash profit3 for current quarter was ₹ 257 crore. Since the Group follows accelerated depreciation, it reported a net loss. Management uses Cash Profit as an important metric of intrinsic performance.</p>
        <br /><p><b>Projects</b></p>
        <p>The Group has won bids for 130 MW wind and 600 MW Hybrid in Q1’2020. Post completion of all the bids won and projects under implementation, the Group’s operational capacity would be 5,2906 MW.</p>
