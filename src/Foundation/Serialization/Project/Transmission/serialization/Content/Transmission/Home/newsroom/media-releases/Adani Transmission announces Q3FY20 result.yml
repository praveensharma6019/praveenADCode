With a growing economy, the demand for power has also increased rapidly over the years and with these growth, coupled with Make in India and Smart Cities will further drive power industry at large. Toward this effort, ATL&rsquo;s focus in FY20 has been in strengthening long-partnerships, expanding our grid network and enhancing customer centricity by supplying power to deficit parts of the country. Our recent acquisitions will make us the country&rsquo;s largest private sector transmission company in India. Through leveraging technology, innovation and commitment to transmitting bulk green power, we always make efforts to deliver and fuel country&rsquo;s power demands&rdquo;</p>
