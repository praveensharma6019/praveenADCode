In line with this commitment, Adani Transmission Limited recently received assessment from CDP – the global environmental disclosure system – to measure risks and opportunities on climate change. The company has received a CDP score of D which is in the Disclosure band. This is lower than the Asia regional average of B-, and lower than Energy utility networks sector average of B. Through global benchmarking and comparison with peers, we endeavor to continuously improve our climate governance.
