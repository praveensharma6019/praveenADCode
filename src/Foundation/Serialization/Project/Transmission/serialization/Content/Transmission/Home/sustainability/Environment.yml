        <p class="mb-3 d-block">We are committed to environment conservation and biodiversity at large. As part of our due diligence, we avoid ecologically sensitive areas such as forests, sanctuaries, national parks, biosphere reserves and Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZs). This is done in line with our agenda of biodiversity management and conservation. We evaluate various alternatives and adopt an optimum plan for each project. The adopted plan entails least impact on biodiversity.   
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">At our generating station at Dahanu we have installed state of art technology to control air and water pollution. To control Particulate Matters generated from the coal burning, Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP) having four passes with six fields & having efficiency 99.91 % have been provided.  To control the Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) emission, Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) unit having efficiency more than 90 % have been commissioned and in operation since October 2007. Due to provision of Over Fire Dampers the NOx emission is within limit since inception, a stack of 275.38 meters height is provided to ensure thin dispersion of the flue gas over a large area. Domestic effluent is being treated in Sewage treatment plant and treated water is utilized in horticulture purpose. Condenser cooling water is being discharged through a zig zag channel of 3.5 km approx. to attain temperature rise less than 5ºC above sea water temperature.  
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Apart from the pollution control measures we have also increase the green cover of the area. At Dahanu only we have developed green belt of 148 hectare land approx. and planted more than 2 Cr mangroves. Apart from this we have done compensatory afforestation of approx. 283 Hectare. We also practice rain water harvesting for ground water recharge purpose.  
        </p>
