        <p><strong style="text-align: justify;">Mumbai, October 18, 2020</strong><span style="text-align: justify;">: </span><span style="text-align: justify;">Considering anticipated load growth in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and realizing that load end generation is reducing compared to load growth, Adani is now committed to executing two critical Transmission Projects that would help channelise additional power to Mumbai, in an expedient and timely manner. These distinct capacity enhancement projects shall create an additional transmission capacity of 1,000 MW each, thereby easing the existing transmission corridors.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The first amongst the two is Kharghar-Vikhroli 400/220 kV EHV transmission line project, will not only ensure an additional 1,000 MW power supply corridor, but will be Mumbai&rsquo;s first 400 KV Substation. It shall enhance reliability and facilitate uninterrupted power supply to India&rsquo;s Financial Capital. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Basis recent review undertaken by Hon&rsquo;ble Chief Minister of Maharashtra Shri Uddhav Thackeray ji, Adani is gearing up to execute the project within the time frame laid down by the State Government and Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) i.e. December 2022, despite the adverse impact of Covid-19. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Adani has already placed orders for all critical&nbsp; equipment&rsquo;s and service contracts, which are vital for project completion, including towers &amp; insulators, as also orders for supply and execution of 400/220 kV Gas Insulated substation (GIS), SCADA and FOTE systems amongst others.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Adani is working with concerned authorities to expedite possession of land parcels at Kharghar and Vikhroli end for establishing GIS Substations as also corridor for laying 400 KV lines. More than 80% of detailed engineering has also been completed as are survey works and preliminary field work has also commenced on the Transmission corridor. Applications for various clearances have been filed and are at advanced stages of consents.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The second critical project with added advantage of islanding is HVDC (VSC based) Link of 80 KMs, between Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company&rsquo;s (MSETCL) 400 kV Kudus &amp; Adani Electricity Mumbai&rsquo;s (AEML) 220 kV Aarey EHV Substation. This is again going to be first if its kind with Underground High Voltage DC Cabled System that shall establish another distinct corridor for injection of an additional 1,000 MW power, right into the load center of Mumbai.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>HVDC (VSC based) technology, is tailor-made and modular in design, requires less footprint compared to conventional technology and has a unique feature of Black Start, whereby ensuring faster restoration of power supply in the events of wide-spread grid disturbances.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The HVDC scheme has been identified as a critical Bulk power injection scheme for Mumbai by all Statutory and Regulatory authorities, including the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), State Transmission Utility (STU) and Hon&rsquo;ble MERC. The HVDC (VSC based) link will act as a virtual generating station and in addition to active power supply, shall also provide reactive power support, enhancing voltage stability and Grid security.</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Adani has initiated land procurement, completed survey works, filed applications for Regulatory, RoW and other Statutory clearances, awarded consultancy contracts for system studies and is in the process of raising capital and finalizing awards for project execution. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Spokesperson of Adani Group said, &ldquo;Adani is committed to completing the Kharghar-Vikhroli transmission line project within the timeline set by Hon&rsquo;ble Chief Minister Shri. Uddhav Thackeray ji. Further, with due support of the State Government and the Statutory and Regulatory authorities, we are confident that the 1000 MW Underground Kudus-Aarey HVDC (VSC) Link shall also be completed in next three years. On completion these two projects will augment Mumbai&rsquo;s Transmission System and will go a long way in ensuring that the Island City continues to get 24x7 power supply&rdquo;.</span></p>
