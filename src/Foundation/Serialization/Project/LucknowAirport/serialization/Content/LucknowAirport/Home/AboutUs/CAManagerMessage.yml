        <p>Welcome to Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport!</p>
        <p>The Capital city of Lucknow has emerged as a major center of trade and commerce. Lucknow is also attracting tremendous tourist traffic as tourists from India and overseas flock to the city of Nawab to watch its historical places, to enjoy its cuisines.</p>
        <p>Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, lies in the middle of the Heritage Arc. This bustling city, famed for its Nawabi era finesse and amazing food, is a unique mix of the ancient and the modern. It is home to extraordinary monuments depicting a fascinating blend of ancient, colonial and oriental architecture. Lucknow was the epicenter of the 1857 War of Independence, and much before that, it was the seat of a line of Nawabs who gave the city its unique identity. Literature, cuisine, performing arts and tehzeeb put Lucknow a cut above the rest &ndash; and the world acknowledges it.&nbsp; Chikan embroidery and zardozi have made Lucknow a brand in global fashion. Kebabs and biryani are the two lip-smacking delicacies that beckon visitors again and again.</p>
