        <p class="pb-3 txt-sm">As the government continues to push through reforms (in the Land Acquisition Act, the Real Estate Regulatory bill, relaxation of FDI rules, etc.), property continues to remain the best option for NRIs looking to invest in India.</p>
        <p class="pb-3 txt-sm">But before making the final decision, there are some big questions to be addressed; who is the developer, what are his credentials, details about the property, location, amenities, payment terms, legalities and so on. Adani Realty offers rewarding investment options across India.</p>
        <p class="pb-3 txt-sm">No project is executed without the help of the finest architects, designers and contractors, and the end result is always splendid. Delving deeper into intricacies of real estate, we understand the needs of our clientele and realize that city life can often become a burden. Our homes are designed to interact with nature, as Louver glass is utilized to allow sunlight through but no sunrays and as a result, dependency on natural light is maximized. Incorporating climatology into realty is just one of the several techniques that Adani Realty has pioneered for indulgent living. Luxury is a priority and no compromises are made when it comes to the comfort of our valued customers.</p>
        <p class="pb-3 txt-sm">Commercial spaces, malls, multiplexes, hotels and IT parks are executed with as much precision as our residential projects and many of our prominent landmarks define the seductive skyline of Mumbai. Because of our obsession with realty, the end result is always a landmark planned with passion!</p>
