        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <li>EBIDTA increased by 45% to Rs. 3,187 crore due to consolidation of Mumbai Airport w.e.f. Q2 FY22 and better margins in IRM business.</li>
        <li>Attributable PAT from Established Businesses increased by 114% to Rs. 1,538 crore due to higher EBIDTA. Overall attributable PAT stood at Rs. 472 Crore.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Financial Highlights Q3 FY22 (Consolidated) (YoY Basis):</strong></p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <li>EBIDTA increased by 4% to Rs. 977 crore.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Our strategy of AEL remaining India’s fastest multi-industry incubator remains unchanged," said <strong>Mr Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group</strong>. "With the IMF recently identifying India as becoming the fastest growing nation coming out of the pandemic, India has the tailwind required to be able to produce multiple companies, both in the digital space and in the physical space, at a pace faster than our country has ever been able to achieve. Add to this the focus on new energy businesses which, by itself, will see the intersection of sustainability and digitization creating a level of value and the kind of jobs that did not even exist a couple of years ago. We are well positioned to capitalize on these trends, the tailwind that will propel India ahead and our ability to execute. Our confidence in the ability of our nation to become one of the fastest incubators of multi-industry unicorns has never been higher."</p>
