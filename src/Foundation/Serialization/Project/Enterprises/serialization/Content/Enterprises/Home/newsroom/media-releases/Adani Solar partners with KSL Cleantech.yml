This region has enormous investment opportunities in renewable energy. KSL Cleantech, as the authorized channel partner of Adani Solar will be responsible for all the solar retail requirements in the region."</span></p>
        <p class="s17" style="margin: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span class="s16">On the retail front, Mr Nair added, "Adani Solar will target a 50% market share. We look forward to achieving a higher reach and visibility for our product nationally by increasing power consumption through alternative forms of energy like solar energy."</span></p>
