        <p>Before announcing each dividend and in consultation with the Stock Exchange, Adani Enterprises' sets a date on which shares will be sold without entitlement to the dividend. This is known as going 'ex-dividend'. Before that date they are said to be 'cum dividend'.<br /><br />If you buy shares before the ex-dividend date you are entitled to receive the dividend recently announced. If you buy on or after that date, in the ex-dividend period, that dividend is payable to the previous owner.<br /><br />The dividend is paid to shareholders based on the number of shares held on the share register at the deadline ('record date'). The record date is currently two days after the ex-dividend date. If you receive a dividend having recently sold your shares and are unsure whether you are entitled to it, contact the agent who acted on your behalf in the sale. Depending on the terms of the sale, the dividend may be due to the new owner.

        <p>To dematerialize your holding, you should first have an account with a Depository Participant (DP) of your choice. You may then hand-over to your DP, the certificates along with the Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF). Only the securities registered in your name can be submitted for dematerialization. Your DP will then send the DRF and the certificates to SSIPL and an electronic request will also be sent through the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) or Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) network reconfirming the same. SSIPL will verify the documents and if found in order, the dematerialization request will be confirmed to NSDL/CDSL who will in turn inform your DP.<br /><br />In the books of the Company, your folio with SSIPL will be debited and the account of NSDL/CDSL will be credited in respect of such dematerialized securities. NSDL/CDSL in their electronic records will credit the account of your DP. Your DP will then credit your account with the number of securities that have been dematerialized and the securities will thereafter be held in electronic form. This process would take approximately 15-20 days.</p>

Pursuant to this provision, the Department of Company Affairs has by Notification No GSR 23(F) dated 12th January, 1999 prescribed Form 2B for making nomination in respect of shares, pursuant to Rules 4CCC and 5D of the Companies (Central Government) General Rules and Forms, 1956.<br /><br />Hence you can make a nomination by filling in and sending Form 2B singly if you are a sole holder or jointly if you are joint holders to SSIPL.
