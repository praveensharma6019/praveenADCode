        <p>&ldquo;AEL continues to prove itself as India&rsquo;s most successful incubator &ndash; and remains unmatched in developing exciting new ideas strategically linked to the Adani portfolio of companies,&rdquo; said <strong>Mr Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group</strong>. &ldquo;AEL is both enhancing the span of companies it is incubating and accelerating the pace at which they are being incubated. We believe this is fundamental value creation in a world where digitisation has become the most significant business transformation vehicle ever known. AEL's existing businesses are stronger than they have ever been &ndash; and, this year, we have launched several new businesses critical to a strong <em>Atmanirbhar Bharat</em>. These include a digital consumer aggregation platform, networked airport ecosystems, green data centres, and advanced road, metro and water infrastructure. I see an exciting journey ahead given that every one of these sectors possesses multiple adjacencies to our existing businesses. Our results demonstrate that this purposeful model is working for us and we will continue to strengthen on all fronts to deliver greater shareholder value.&rdquo;</p>
