        <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
        Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) is the flagship company of Adani Group, one of India&rsquo;s largest multi-infrastructure organisations. Over the years, Adani Enterprises has focused on building emerging infrastructure businesses, contributing to nation-building and divesting them into separate listed entities. Having successfully built unicorns like Adani Transmission, Adani Power, Adani Ports &amp; SEZ, Adani Green Energy and the recently formed Adani Gas, the company has contributed significantly to make the country self-reliant with our current portfolio of robust businesses. The next generation of its strategic business investments are centered on the fields of solar PV manufacturing, airport management, data centers &amp; technology parks, and water infrastructure. Following these principles has led to very strong returns to our shareholders. A one-rupee investment in Adani Enterprises, which was the group&rsquo;s first IPO in 1994, has returned over 800X.<br />
