        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Group commented</strong> - “Our foray into defence and aerospace has a deep personal significance for me. I want us to be able to look back and reflect that the Adani Group did its bit to help build a more self-reliant India – the nation that is second to none in its defence manufacturing capabilities – the nation that is stronger in its ability to defend itself. As an Indian - there could be nothing more gratifying. It is a critical milestone for the trusted and strategic relationship between our nations - India and Israel. This joint venture facility for the manufacturing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is a testament to Elbit’s commitment to our nation and the ‘Make in India’ programme”</p>

Adani Group has a long history of entrepreneurship, spanning through decades of dynamic growth. We are proud of our enduring relationship with Adani Group and look forward to partnering in developing defence ecosystem in India.”</p>
