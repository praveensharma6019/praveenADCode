        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Ahmedabad, June 13, 2017:</strong> Adani Group, a global integrated infrastructure conglomerate, today announced commissioning of 50 MW solar PV plant in&nbsp;Mahoba, Uttar Pradesh, under the National Solar Mission Scheme, with an&nbsp;<br />
        investment of Rs. 315 cr.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        The technology used for setting up this plant includes String Inverter Technology&nbsp;which is 1st of its kind in UP with crystalline silicon modules that allows miniature&nbsp;level control of solar power generation. The transmission line runs up to a stretch&nbsp;of 21.5 km. The power generated by this plant will be evacuated by 132 kv&nbsp;transmission line to UPTCL, Mahoba Substation under agreement signed with&nbsp;NTPC. Indirect and direct employment opportunities were created for a total of&nbsp;around 250 personnel, who worked diligently to achieve this feat, and employment&nbsp;opportunities will be provided through the generation period as well.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        “We are delighted to have achieved the setting up of this plant, helping us prove&nbsp;our dedicated efforts towards nation building as well as showing our commitment&nbsp;to the government’s green energy mission. We are moving closer to our aim of&nbsp;revolutionizing the renewable energy sector in India. We would like to extend our&nbsp;heartiest gratitude to the UP government officials for their support and playing a&nbsp;huge role in helping us achieve the smooth commissioning of this plant,” <strong>said Mr.&nbsp;Jayant Parimal, CEO, Renewable Energy Business, Adani Group.</strong><br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Apart from the 100 MW Solar Power Plant in Bhatinda, the company also has a 40&nbsp;MW solar plant at Bitta, Gujarat and has also recently unveiled a 648 MW solar&nbsp;power plant at Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu which is the world’s largest&nbsp;solar power plant at a single location. &nbsp;With this plant the company has added&nbsp;another 50 MW to the existing portfolio. Adani Group capacity in solar energy goes&nbsp;up to 838 MW, spreading across Gujarat, Tamilnadu, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">Thus, by the end of this year Adani Group will be above 2 GW of solar installed&nbsp;capacity making the company the largest player in India’s renewable energy sector&nbsp;in various states. Till now we have generated 1472 GWH of solar energy from above&nbsp;plants which have reduced CO2 emission by 650590 MT.&nbsp;<br />
