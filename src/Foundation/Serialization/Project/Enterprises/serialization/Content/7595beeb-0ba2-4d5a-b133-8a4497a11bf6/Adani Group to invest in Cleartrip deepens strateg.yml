Since the acquisition by the Flipkart Group, Cleartrip has seen 10x growth in flight bookings. Also, trends observed by Adani airports indicate that the number of passengers at airports has increased, reaching close to pre-covid highs. This partnership will further enable Cleartrip to transcend digital boundaries and bring end-to-end travel services online. </span></p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Cleartrip&rsquo;s scalable technology stack, user-friendly interface and industry-first initiatives <span style="background: white;">have made it one of the most loved travel brands in India. This, along with an experienced leadership team and Flipkart&rsquo;s deep consumer-focused experience, has helped the company stabilize its prominent position in the OTA space over the last few months. By collaborating with the Adani Group in areas such as travel-related products, loyalty programs and other value-added services, </span></span></p>

The Cleartrip platform will become an essential part of the broader SuperApp journey we have embarked upon.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Speaking on the development, <strong>Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Chief Executive Officer, Flipkart Group,</strong> said, &ldquo;At the Flipkart Group, we are focused on delivering experiences for consumers and providing opportunities to help them fulfil their aspirations. As travel picks up over the next few months, Cleartrip will continue to focus on providing easy and flexible travel experiences for its customers.
