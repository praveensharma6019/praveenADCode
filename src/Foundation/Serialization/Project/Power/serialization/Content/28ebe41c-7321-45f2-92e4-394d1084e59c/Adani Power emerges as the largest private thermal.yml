        <p dir="ltr">Consolidated total income for the year increased by 24% to Rs 19,545 crore compared to Rs 15,768 crore in the same period last year. Revenue increased because of higher Effective Operational Capacity of 8,891 MW as compared to 7,182 MW in the corresponding previous year. The consolidated EBIDTA increased by 17% to Rs 6,083 crore compared to Rs 5,211 crore in the same period last year.</p>

        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">Exceptional item during the quarter and the year is mainly due to gain arising as a result of demerger of transmission business and subsequent stake sale of transmission business to Adani Transmission Limited.</p>

        <p dir="ltr">During the quarter and the year, the company has revised the estimated useful life of the Fixed Assets as prescribed in Schedule-II of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently the depreciation charge for the quarter and the year is lower by Rs 720 crore.</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">Commenting on the financial performance of the Company Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Power said, “The past year has been a momentous one for everyone at Adani Power as we became India’s largest Private power producer and now with the completion of acquisition of Udupi Power Plant our installed capacity has increased to 10,440 MW.
