I would like to express our deepest gratitude to the Hon’ble Chief Minister and the government of Tamil Nadu for their valuable support and guidance in achieving this gigantic feat”.</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p dir="ltr">The &nbsp;massive plant comprises of 3,80, 000 foundations, 25,00,000 solar modules, 27,000 Mt of structure, 576 nos of inverters, 154 nos of transformers and 6000 km length of cables. The entire plant was completed in all shape and ready to generate the 648 MW of clean and green energy. The entire 648 MW is now connected with Kamuthi 400 KV substation of Tantransco making it the <strong>WORLD’S LARGEST SOLAR POWER PLANT AT A SINGLE LOCATION</strong>.</p>
