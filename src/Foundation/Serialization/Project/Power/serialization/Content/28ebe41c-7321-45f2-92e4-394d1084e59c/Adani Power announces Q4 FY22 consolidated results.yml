        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Ahmedabad, May 5th, 2022: </strong>Adani Power Ltd. [“APL”], a part of the Adani Group, today announced the financial results for the quarter and year ended March 31st, 2022. </p>
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Electricity Demand and Supply in India</strong> </p><br />
        <p>Electricity demand continues to grow strongly in India, driven both by economic growth and a heatwave in the north-western parts of the country.  Aggregate energy demand for FY 2021-22 across the nation was 1,380 Bn Units (BU), registering a growth of 8.2% over the energy demand for FY 2020-21. Similarly, peak power demand registered a growth of 6.7% to reach a record level of 203 GW in FY 2021-22 as compared to FY 2020-21. Peak power deficit widened to 1.2% during FY 2021-22, as compared to 0.4% during FY 2020-21, while energy deficit was steady at 0.4%. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Recent geopolitical events in Europe have resulted in a sharp increase in global fuel prices, including coal, petroleum, and natural gas. This has in turn affected the ability of a number of thermal power plants in India to generate power at viable costs, restricting their output. As a result of supply constraints in face of a growing demand for power, average market clearing price of electricity on exchanges rose to Rs. 8.23/kWh in the Day Ahead Market in March 2022. </p>
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Business updates for Q4 FY 2021-22</strong> </p><br />
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>• The Company completed the acquisition of Essar Power M P Limited (“EPMPL”), a company undergoing insolvency resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, on 16th March 2022.
