        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Ahmedabad, April 08, 2013: </strong>Adani Enterprises, the flagship company of the&nbsp;Adani Group, a global integrated infrastructure player, today announced&nbsp;commencement of its ambitious integrated coal mine developer cum operator&nbsp;(MDO) operations with the start of coal production at the Parsa East-Kente&nbsp;Basan mine in Chhattisgarh, owned Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd&nbsp;(RRVUNL), a state-run power generation utility of Rajasthan.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">This is the first amongst the four MDO contracts bagged by Adani Enterprises&nbsp;and marks the beginning of Adani Group’s “Resources”&nbsp;business vertical in&nbsp;India. The company has outlined a phased capital outlay of Rs 3,000 crore for&nbsp;the entire block.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">With this development, Adani Enterprises is set to emerge as the largest&nbsp;private coal miner with access to produce coal of up to 90 million tonnes and&nbsp;reserves of over 3 billion tonnes over next 30 years, enough to produce about&nbsp;18,000 megawatts of electricity by state electricity boards.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Group said, “The commencement of coal&nbsp;mining at Parsa Kente is a milestone event in coal mining sector. With this we&nbsp;at Adani rededicate ourselves to work resolutely towards energy security of&nbsp;the country.”</p>

        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">The Parsa East- Kente Basan block is located in Chhattisgarh and was awarded&nbsp;to RRVUNL in 2007. RRVUNL issued a tender seeking MDO services which was&nbsp;bagged by Adani Enterprises. The contract is now being executed by Adani&nbsp;Mining, a 100 percent subsidiary of Adani Enterprises. The block holds reserves&nbsp;of over 450 million tonnes of coal and will produce 2 million tonnes a year&nbsp;initially to be ramped to 15 million tonnes a year from 2017 onwards.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">As per the contract, Adani Mining will also set up a coal washery, a coal&nbsp;handling plan and railway siding infrastructure to transport the coal at the&nbsp;doorstep of RRVUNL’s fuel-starved power plants in Rajasthan.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">The washed coal from Parsa East- Kante Basan block will be of a superior&nbsp;quality and will help RRVUNL run its power plants at a plant load factor of over&nbsp;95 percent and will make the state power surplus from its current situation of&nbsp;being electricity deficient and massive load shedding.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">Relatively new in India, MDO is a concept where in a coal block owner&nbsp;contracts entire operations to a third party, which takes the responsibility of&nbsp;land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation, mining, developing and&nbsp;operating the particular mine by investing in it and then supplying the coal at a&nbsp;tender determined price to the power plants of the mine owning state electricity boards.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">The other three MDO blocks contracted to Adani Enterprises are – Parsa block&nbsp;in Chhattisgarh, owned by Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Co Ltd with&nbsp;reserves of 150 million tonnes, Machakatta block in Odisha owned by MahaGuj&nbsp;Collieries Ltd with reserves of 1.2 billion tonnes and Chendipada coal block,&nbsp;also in Odisha, owned by UCM Coal Company Ltd with reserves of 1.5 billion&nbsp;tonnes.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">The Adani Group aims to produce 200 million tonnes of coal across its mining&nbsp;assets globally by 2020. The group has a producing mine in Indonesia and has&nbsp;just flagged off an impressive coal exploration programme in the Carmichael&nbsp;mine, the biggest coal mine tenement in the world in the Galilee Basin of&nbsp;Queensland Australia. The group plans to commence production of coal from&nbsp;its Australian operations by 2016.</p>
