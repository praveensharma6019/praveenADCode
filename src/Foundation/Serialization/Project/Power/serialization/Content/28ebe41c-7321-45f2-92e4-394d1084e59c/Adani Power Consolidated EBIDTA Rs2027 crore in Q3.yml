        	<li>Consolidated Total Income for Q3FY16 increased by 12% to Rs 6,211 crore compared to Rs 5,538 crore in Q3FY15, mainly due to additional sale from Udupi plant.</li>
        	<li>Consolidated EBIDTA for Q3FY16 increased by 13% to Rs 2,027 crore compared to Rs 1,793 crore in Q3FY15. EBIDTA impact due to demerger of transmission business for Q3FY15 of Rs. 155 Cr., was more than compensated by EBIDTA from UPCL, improved operational efficiencies and lower costs in Q3FY16.</li>
        	<li>Depreciation charge during Q3FY16 is Rs 607 crores and is not comparable with Q3FY15, as the company had given the impact of Schedule-II of the Companies Act, 2013.</li>
        	<li>Interest expenses during Q3FY16 decreased to Rs 1,318 crores from Rs. 1,481 crores during Q3FY15, mainly due to refinancing of rupee loans resulting in reduction of interest on rupee term loans and lower foreign exchange fluctuation impact on working capital facilities.</li>
