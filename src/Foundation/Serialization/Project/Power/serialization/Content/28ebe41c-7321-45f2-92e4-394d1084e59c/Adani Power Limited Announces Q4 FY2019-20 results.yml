        <p style=" margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Average Plant Load Factor (PLF) achieved during the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March 2020 was 68%, as compared to 64% achieved in the previous year. The PLF was higher despite Annual Overhaul (&ldquo;AOH&rdquo;) and Capital Overhaul (&ldquo;COH&rdquo;) of 11 units during the year compared to 4 units in the previous year due to higher domestic coal materialization and execution of Supplementary Power Purchase Agreement (&ldquo;SPPA&rdquo;) in Adani Power (Mundra) Ltd. (&ldquo;APMuL&rdquo;).</span></p>
        <p style=" margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style=" margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Units sold during the year were 16% higher at 64.1 Billion Units (BU) as compared to 55.2 BU sold during the previous year, due to higher PLF and sale of power of 4.3 BU from Raigarh Energy Generation Ltd. (&ldquo;REGL&rdquo;) and Raipur Energen Ltd (&ldquo;REL&rdquo;).</span></p>
        <p style=" margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

The EBITDA includes net regulatory income pertaining to prior periods of Rs. 1,285 cores during the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March 2020, compared to Rs. 2,864 Crore in the previous year based on the regulatory orders received during the respective periods.

(-) 2,275 Crore, as compared to loss after tax and exceptional items of Rs. (-) 984 Crore for the previous year. The loss for the year includes exceptional item of Rs. 1,003 Crore, pertaining to the write off of certain receivables and advances, owing to the acceptance of resolution plan submitted by the company for acquisition of Korba West Power Co. Ltd., which is now renamed to REGL.</span></p>

        <p style=" margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Lower PLF during the quarter, in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the previous year was primarily on account of AOH/ COH in APMuL and Udupi Power Corporation Limited (&ldquo;UPCL&rdquo;) units during the current quarter. Further, subdued power demand and increased penetration of renewable energy also impacted the capacity utilisation of the Kawai and Udupi power plants.</span></p>

        <p style=" margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>The consolidated total income during the quarter was lower mainly due to recognition of carrying cost of Rs. 1,198 Crore during the corresponding quarter of the previous year and lower revenue in APMuL and UPCL in the current quarter due to low PLF, partly compensated by revenue from REL and REGL.</span></p>
        <p style=" margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p style=" margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>EBITDA</span><span> for the quarter was lower mainly due to onetime recognition of carrying cost of Rs. 1,198 Crore during the corresponding previous quarter, additional onetime provision of Rs. 184 Crore in the quarter, lower </span><span>EBITDA</span><span> in APMuL due to lower PLF and unfavourable foreign exchange movement in quarter, as compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year.</span></p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Depreciation and interest charge during the quarter were higher mainly due to the incorporation of the consolidation of REL and REGL.</span></p>
