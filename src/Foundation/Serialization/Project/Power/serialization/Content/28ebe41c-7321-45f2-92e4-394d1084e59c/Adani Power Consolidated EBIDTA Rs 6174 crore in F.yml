Our Tiroda and Kawai power plants have now started to receive domestic coal under SHAKTI scheme FSAs, which will improve their profitability and help supply electricity at competitive rates. We continue to be in discussion with key stakeholders to identify a solution for the Mundra power plant, which has been impacted financially due to under-recovery of fuel costs. We are confident of achieving our long term goals and contributing significantly to nation building.”</p>
