        <br />
        Consolidated total income for the quarter increased by 13% to Rs 5,914 crore compared to Rs 5,225 crore in the corresponding period in previous year. Revenue during the quarter increased due to improved PLF and additional revenue of Rs 569 crores contributed by UPCL. The consolidated EBIDTA remained at Rs 1,633 crore in Q1FY16 as compared to Rs 1,691 crore in Q1FY15 due to higher compensatory tariff recognized and impact of demerger of Transmission business in the previous quarter.
