        <p dir="ltr">Adani Power Ltd, India’s largest thermal private power producer and part of the Adani Group, a global integrated player, today announced that its state-of-the-art 4620 megawatts (MW) power plant at Mundra, has set a record by attaining the highest generation of 4,644 MW, making it the only power station of such a gigantic size to reach a significant milestone in electricity production. The generation so far was constrained due to inadequate evacuation capacity, which has been alleviated with guidance, support and cooperation of various state and central grid authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">Adani Power has a thermal power generating capacity of 7,920 MW, consisting of 4620 MW at Mundra, 1980 MW at Tiroda and 1320 at Kawai. The Mundra plant, which is one of the world’s largest private coal based power station at a single location, has five units of 660 MW and four units of 330 MW each. All the 660 MW units are based on environment friendly supercritical technology.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">“Adani Power is committed to narrow the demand supply gap in electricity in India. We are proud that the Mundra plant has surpassed its installed capacity of 4620 MW.&nbsp; This is a national record in the Indian power sector. We, at Adani, are devoted towards nation building and this project is dedicated to the people of India. We are confident of achieving a target of generating 9,240 MW of electricity by March 2014,” said Mr. Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Group.</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">“Achieving 4644 MW power generation at Mundra is one more feather in the cap of our Mundra plant. The state-of-the-art technology used in this project and Adani’s expertise in management of such complex projects are key to its success. We hope to replicate this feat at our other projects too,” said Mr. Vneet S Jaain, CEO, Adani Power.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">The company is evacuating the electricity from the Mundra power plant via a 400 kV transmission line from Mundra to Dehgam in Gujarat covering 430 KM and a 500 kV high voltage direct current line from Mundra to Mohindergarh in Haryana, covering over 1000 KM.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">The Mundra plant is also the world’s first coal fired power project to receive carbon credits. It is generating about 1.8 million Certified Emission Reductions each year.</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">Adani Power is currently implementing a coal-fired project of 3300 MW at Tiroda, Maharashtra.</p>
        
        <br />
        
        <p dir="ltr">About Supercritical Technology</p>
        <br />
        <p dir="ltr">The Supercritical power plants operate at higher temperatures and pressures and therefore achieve higher efficiencies compared to conventional sub-critical power plants. The use of supercritical technology leads to significant CO2 emission reductions.</p>
