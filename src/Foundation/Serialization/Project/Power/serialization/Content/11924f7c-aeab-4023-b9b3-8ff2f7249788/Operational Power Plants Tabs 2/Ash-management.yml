        <p class="pl-4 mb-3">APML has undertaken numerous initiatives towards Fly Ash utilisation generated during the power generation process. Despite major challenges such as non-availability of Lime Stone nearby which restricts cement manufacturing for fly ash utilisation, APML has achieved fly ash utilisation to the tune of 48% through supply of fly ash to cement plants in the region and other initiatives such as establishment of fly ash brick plant, educating and encouraging local farmers to utilise fly ash in agriculture etc. We have installed HCSD(high concentration slurry disposal) system for 100% dry ash utilisation by creating mounds to increase ash utilization.</p>
        <p class="pl-4 mb-3">The plant is equipped with latest pollution control equipment such as high efficiency electrostatic precipitators- the largest in Asia, Dust extraction & Suppression system, 275 M high chimney, to limit the SPM, SOx, NOx emissions well within the prescribed permissible limits.</p>
