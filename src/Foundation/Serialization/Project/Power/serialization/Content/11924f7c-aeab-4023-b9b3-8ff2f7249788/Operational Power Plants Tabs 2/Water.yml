        <p class="pl-4 mb-3">The plant has water requirement of 70 Million cubic meter per annum which is sourced from nearby Wainganga river. The makeup water pump house installed by APML on river Wainganga draws water from the source. APML has laid 2 pipes of 9 Kms length each along the route to ensure uninterrupted supply of water to four reservoirs 16, 39, 33 & 23  hectares each at plant location. The water from the Wainganga river caters the water requirement to plant mainly for condenser cooling, various plant process and for domestic use. Induced draft cooling towers are installed to cool the circulating water for reuse. Entire plant is designed on zero discharge philosophy.</p>
