        <p>To dematerialize your holding, you should first have an account with a Depository Participant (DP) of your choice. You may then hand-over to your DP, the certificates along with the Dematerialisation Request Form (DRF). Only the securities registered in your name can be submitted for dematerialization. Your DP will then send the DRF and the certificates to SSIPL and an electronic request will also be sent through the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) or Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) network reconfirming the same.SSIPL will verify the documents and if found in order, the dematerialization request will be confirmed to NSDL/CDSL who will in turn inform your DP. In the books of the Company, your folio with SSIPL will be debited and the account of NSDL/CDSL will be credited in respect of such dematerialized securities.NSDL/CDSL in their electronic records will credit the account of your DP. Your DP will then credit your account with the number of securities that have been dematerialized and the securities will thereafter be held in electronic form.This process would take approximately 15-20 days. </p>

        <p>With a view to enabling the shareholders to appoint nominees for their shareholding(s), the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999has made provision under which a shareholder can now nominate a person in whom the share or debenture or deposit would vest with, in the event of former's death. Pursuant to this provision, the Department of Company Affairs has by Notification No GSR 23(F) dated 12th January, 1999 prescribed Form 2B for making nomination in respect of shares, pursuant to Rules 4CCC and 5D of the Companies (Central Government) General Rules and Forms, 1956. Hence you can make a nomination by filling in and sending Form 2B singly if you are a sole holder or jointly if you are joint holders to KCPL. After verifying your signatures your nomination would be registered and an intimation of the same would be sent to you, which you are requested to preserve to avoid any future Important points to note o Always include your complete address along with pin code while filling in the transferdeed/opening an account with a Depository Participant o Keep photocopies of certificates, transfer deeds and other documents sent by post to KCPL. In case of a loss in transit, they come handy. o A transfer deed for shares is valid for only one year from the date of presentation or the last book closure of the company, whichever is later</p>
