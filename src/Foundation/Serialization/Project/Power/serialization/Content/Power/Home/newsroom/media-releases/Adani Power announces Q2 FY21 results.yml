        <p><strong><span>Ahmedabad<sup>, </sup>November 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020: </span></strong><span>Adani Power Ltd. [&ldquo;APL&rdquo;], a part of Adani Group, today announced the financial results<a href="file:///C:/Users/30021549/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/T37GLUW4/APL_Draft%20Media%20Release%20Q2%20FY21%20Final.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a> for the second quarter ended 30<sup>th</sup> September 2020.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Key developments</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court, vide its order dated 31<sup>st</sup> Aug, 2020, partially allowed claims of Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. (APRL), APL&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary, to recover compensatory tariff from Rajasthan DISCOMs as per the order of the Hon&rsquo;ble Appellate Tribunal Of Electricity (APTEL) dated 14<sup>th</sup> September 2019. However, Rajasthan DISCOMs have filed a review petition in the Hon&rsquo;ble Supreme Court.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Further, APTEL has also allowed, vide its order dated 5<sup>th</sup> &nbsp;October 2020, appeal by Adani Power Maharashtra Ltd. (APML), APL&rsquo;s wholly owned subsidiary, against an order of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) regarding coal shortfall compensation due to de-allocation of the Lohara coal block, along with carrying cost</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Operating performance</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>During the second quarter of FY 2020-21, APL and its subsidiaries&nbsp; achieved an Average Plant Load Factor (PLF) of 49.9% and sales volume of 12.6 Billion Units (BU), as compared to a PLF of 59.2% and sales volume of 14.5 BU recorded in the second quarter of FY 2019-20. This lower performance was primarily a result of customer back-downs in Maharashtra and a subdued merchant market, partially offset by higher grid demand and improved coal availability in Rajasthan, as well as full quarter utilization of the recently acquired power plants in Chhattisgarh.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>During the six months ended 30th September 2020, APL and its subsidiaries achieved an average PLF of 50.4% and sales of 25.3 BU, as compared to a PLF of 65% and sales volume of 31 BU in the six months ended 30th September 2019. Performance during the first quarter of FY21 was affected due to a drop in power demand, following the COVID-19 lockdown.</span></p>
        <p><strong><span>Financial performance</span></strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Consolidated Total Income for Q2 FY 2020-21 stood at Rs. 8,792 crore, as compared to Rs. 6,815 crore in Q2 FY 2019-20. This includes one-time revenue recognition of Rs. 3,624 crore, mainly towards compensatory tariff and carrying cost in Q2 FY 2020-21, as compared to Rs. 730 crore in Q2 FY 2019-20. This one-time revenue recognition in the current quarter was on account of regulatory approvals of APML&rsquo;s claims for coal shortfall compensation and carrying costs.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Consolidated Total Income for the first half of FY 2020-21 stood at Rs. 14,148 crore, as compared to Rs. 14,830 crore in H1 FY 2019-20.

        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The EBITDA for Q2 FY 2020-21 stood higher at Rs. 5,086 crore, as compared to Rs. 2,248 crore in Q2 FY 2019-20, mainly due to one-time revenue recognition.&nbsp;</span></p>

The depreciation charge for the corresponding previous quarter was lower due to incorporation of the consolidation of REL and REGL during the course of the quarter.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Depreciation charge for H1 FY 2020-21 was Rs. 1,610 crore, as compared to Rs. 1,455 crore in H1 FY 2019-20, with the increase attributable to incorporation of the consolidation of REL and REGL during the course of Q2 FY 2019-20.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Profit Before Tax for Q2 FY 2020-21 was Rs. 2,894 crore, as compared to Rs. 158 crore for Q2 FY 2019-20. The Total Comprehensive Income after Tax was Rs. 2,216 crore for Q2 FY 2020-21, as compared to Rs. 3 crore for Q2 FY 2019-20.</span></p>
