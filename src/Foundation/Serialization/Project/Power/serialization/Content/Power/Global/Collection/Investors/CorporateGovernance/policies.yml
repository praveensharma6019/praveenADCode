        <p style="font-size: 12px;padding-bottom: 10px;" />Pursuant to Adani Power Limited’s commitment for “growth with goodness” and value creation by keeping ESG principles, APL has established a claw-back policy that is applicable to CEO and all senior management employee(s) in the company. This policy is adopted to safeguard the interest of all the stakeholders against possible misconduct by senior management employee(s) that may cause re-statement of financial statement at a later date. <p />
