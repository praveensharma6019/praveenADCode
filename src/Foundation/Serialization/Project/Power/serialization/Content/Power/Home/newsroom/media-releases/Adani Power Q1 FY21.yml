        <p><strong>, 2020: <sup>th</sup>Ahmedabad, August 6</strong> for the first quarter of FY 2020-21. Adani Power Ltd, a part of Adani Group, today announced the financial results</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Operating performance</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Average Plant Load Factor (PLF) achieved during the first quarter of FY21 is 51%, as compared to 78% achieved in Q1 FY 20.  The PLF is lower due to the decline in power demand following the announcement of a nationwide lockdown to combat COVID-19. Consolidated Units sold for the quarter are 12.7 BU, as compared to the Q1 FY20 sales volume of 16.5 BU.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the lockdown, the 3,300 MW Tiroda plant saw good demand for power for major part of the quarter, due to its advantageous position in the Maharashtra merit order.  The 1,320 MW Kawai plant also saw improving PLF in the month of June 2020, after the lockdown was relaxed and power demand started to normalize.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">However, the Udupi plant witnessed a sharp fall in PLF due to a slump in power demand. The Mundra plant’s PLF was also affected by lower power demand and subdued short term market tariffs. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, all power plants were able to achieve or exceed normative availability under long term PPAs through diligent efforts, despite restrictions imposed during the lockdown, in fulfilment of their role as providers of the essential service of electricity generation.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p><strong>Financial performance</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Consolidated total revenue for Q1 FY21 stood at Rs. 5,356 crore as compared to Rs. 8,015 crore in Q1 F20. Adjusted for one-time revenue recognition and prior period items, the normalized revenue for the quarter was Rs. 5,353 crore, as compared to Rs. 6,892 crore for the corresponding previous quarter. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Consolidated EBITDA for Q1 FY21 declined to Rs. 1,541 crore as compared to Rs. 2,894 crore for Q1 FY20. EBITDA for the quarter was lower mainly due to higher one-time income recognized in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, lower EBITDA of Mundra due to lower PLF, and incorporation of operating expenses of REL and REGL post-acquisition.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Depreciation and interest charge during the quarter were higher mainly due to the incorporation of the consolidation of REL and REGL. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The results of the corresponding previous quarter included exceptional item of Rs. 1,004 Crore, pertaining to the write off of certain receivables and advances, owing to the acceptance of resolution plan submitted by the company for acquisition of REGL (previously Korba West Power Co. Ltd.). In comparison, Q1 FY21 has not recorded any exceptional items.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The loss after tax and exceptional items for Q1 FY21 was Rs. (-) 682 Crore, as compared to loss after tax and exceptional items of Rs. (-) 263 Crore for Q1 FY20. The Total Comprehensive Loss after Tax was Rs. (-) 705 Crore for Q1 FY21, as compared to a Total Comprehensive Loss of Rs. (-) 266 Crore for the corresponding quarter of the previous year.</p>
