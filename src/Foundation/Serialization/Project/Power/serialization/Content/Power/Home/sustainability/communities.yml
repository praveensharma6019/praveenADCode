        <p class="mb-3 d-block">We identify the community as one of our key stakeholders and we work closely with them at all our business locations. Our community engagement starts with social need identification early in the stage of project planning and runs through the entire life cycle of the project. To begin with, our team has formal and informal interactions with the local communities to understand their needs well in advance of the commencement of the project work.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-3 d-block">We also take help of external expert agencies for need identification in a formal way. The needs are then bucketed into core areas of education, health, livelihood and infrastructure development. Based on these needs, relevant social intervention programmes are designed and implemented. We also carry out social impact assessment at defined intervals and initiate changes in our CSR programmes based on the stakeholders&rsquo; inputs and the outcome of the impact assessment. </p>

        <p class="mb-3 d-block">We have a system to receive and address grievances of local communities at operating locations. Suggestions and demands by local communities shared informally are routed through the Gram Panchayat and discussed in the presence of the village development committee. Our CSR team provides support to the community if suggestions are related to the latter&rsquo;s advantage. We periodically conduct impact assessment studies of our CSR initiatives at all operating locations. Impact assessment of CSR activities is done on a rolling basis so that every individual location is covered once in five years.</p>
