        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <br />
        <p>Operating performance during the third quarter of FY 2019-20 includes the performance of the 1,370 MW power plant of Raipur Energen Ltd. [&ldquo;REL&rdquo;], which was acquired on August 2nd, 2019, while the performance of the 600 MW power plant of Raigarh Energy Generation Ltd. [&ldquo;REGL&rdquo;], which was acquired on July 20th, 2019 is not included as it is in a ramp up phase. Consolidated financial performance for the relevant periods includes both REL and REGL. </p>
        <br />
        <p>During the Q3 FY 2019-20, APL, along with the power plants of its subsidiaries at Mundra, Tiroda, Kawai, and Udupi achieved an Average Plant Load Factor [&ldquo;PLF&rdquo;] of 70%, while the Raipur power plant of REL achieved a PLF of 55%. Aggregate sales volumes for Q3 FY 2019-20 were 16.4 Billion Units [&ldquo;BU&rdquo;]. In comparison, during Q3 FY 2018-19, APL and its subsidiaries achieved an average PLF of 73% and sales volume of 15.8 BU. This lower PLF during Q3 FY2019-20 was primarily a result of lower grid demand and higher renewable energy generation, while the inclusion of REL helped improve sales volumes. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Consolidated Total Income for Q3 FY 2019-20 stood at Rs. 6,685 Crore, as compared to Rs. 6,667 Crore in Q3 FY 2018-19. This includes revenue recognition pertaining to earlier periods amounting to Rs. 20 Crore towards compensation for change in law &amp; carrying cost, and late payment surcharge in Q3 FY 2019-20, as compared to Rs. 205 Crore in Q3 FY 2018-19. The contribution of REL and REGL to consolidated revenues of Q3 FY2019-20 was Rs. 482 Crore.  </p>
        <br />
        <p>The EBITDA for Q3 FY 2019-20 stood at Rs. 1,557 Crore, as compared to Rs. 1,372 Crore in Q3 FY 2018-19, chiefly due to improved fuel cost recovery including compensatory tariffs.  </p>
        <br />
        <p>Depreciation charge for Q3 FY 2019-20 was at Rs. 783 Crore, after incorporating the consolidation of REL and REGL, as compared to Rs. 682 Crore in Q3 FY 2018-19,</p>
        <br />
        <p>The Loss before tax and exceptional items for Q3 FY 2019-20 was Rs. (-) 649 Crore, as compared to Rs. (-) 840 Crore for Q3 FY 2018-19. The Total Comprehensive Loss after Tax was Rs. (-) 703 Crore for Q3 FY 2019-20, as compared to Rs. (-) 1,180 Crore for Q3 FY 2018-19.</p>

        <p><strong>Performance during 9M FY 2019-20</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>During the nine months ended December 31st, 2019, APL and the power plants of its subsidiaries at Mundra, Tiroda, Kawai, and Udupi achieved an Average Plant Load Factor (PLF) of 70% while the Raipur plant of REL achieved a PLF of 53%.  Aggregate sales volumes for the period were 47.5 BU.  In comparison, APL and its subsidiaries achieved a PLF of 59% and sales volume of 38.6 BU in the nine months ended December 31st, 2018. This 23% growth in aggregate sales volume was due to improved availability of domestic coal at the Tiroda and Kawai plants, higher Declared Capacity of the Mundra plant following the implementation of the High Powered Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, and inclusion of REL. This growth was partially offset by lower generation at the Udupi plant owing to lower grid demand due to the heavy monsoons, and higher generation from renewable energy sources in Karnataka. </p>

        <p>Consolidated Total Income for the first nine months of FY 2019-20 grew by 18% to Rs. 21,514 Crore, as compared to Rs. 18,284 Crore for the first nine months of FY 2018-19.

        <br />
        <p>During 9M 2019-20, Exceptional Items of Rs. 1,003 Crore were recognized pertaining to the write-off of certain receivables and advances, owing to the acceptance of the Resolution Plan submitted by the Company for the acquisition of the Korba West Power Co. Ltd. </p>
