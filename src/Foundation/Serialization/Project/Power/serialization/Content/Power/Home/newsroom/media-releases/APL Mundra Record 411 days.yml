        <p><strong style="text-align: justify;">Ahmedabad, 12<sup>th</sup> August 2020:</strong><span style="text-align: justify;"> Adani Power Mundra Limited, a subsidiary of Adani Power Limited, today said that a 660 MW supercritical unit (U#7) at 4620 MW Mundra Power Thermal Plant has created a new national record by running continuously for 411 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>According to industry data, a unit at </span><span>TCPL, Nellore<strong> </strong>power plant had earlier run for 410 days in supercritical category. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>As we go to press, the unit is still operational and continues to build on a new generation record. </span></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The 660 MW supercritical facility generated 5132 million units of electricity during this uninterrupted operation. What is even more remarkable is that the feat was achieved with 79.01% PLF and Zero Specific Oil Consumption "The continuous operation of the thermal unit, without any interruptions amidst a global pandemic speaks of the ability of our team to harness complexities of technology and amplify scale of operations involved in it&rdquo;, said <strong><span>Mr. Anil Sardana, Managing Director, Adani Power Limited</span></strong></p>
        <p> <span>This was not the first record established by APL. Earlier, Mundra subcritical asset too had entered the record books. In 2017, Mundra Power Plant, sub-critical 330 MW unit had created a similar national record of continuous running for 684 days. The Mundra power plant operates nine units. Five of these units are supercritical units of 660 MW each and the balance four units are sub-critical units of 330 MW each, taking the total generation of the power plant to 4,620 MW.</span></p>
