        <p><strong>Ahmedabad, August 5<sup>th</sup>, 2021: </strong>Adani Power Ltd. [&lsquo;APL&rsquo;], a part of Adani Group, today announced the financial results for the first quarter of FY 2021-22. APL and subsidiaries achieved improved operational and financial performance in Q1 FY22 as compared to the corresponding quarter of FY21 on back of improved electricity demand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Electricity Demand and Supply</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Electricity demand in the country has recovered smartly after the slump witnessed during the COVID-19 lockdown in Q1 FY21. Resumption of normal economic activity, coupled with inherent demand drivers has propelled the aggregate electricity demand to 341 BU in Q1 FY22, which is 16% higher than demand of 293 BU during Q1 FY21. Peak power demand has also improved sharply to 194 Giga Watts [&lsquo;GW&rsquo;] in Q1 FY22, as compared to 167 GW in Q1 FY21. After the quarter end, peak demand has continued to grow and has reached an all-time high of over 200 GW on July 7, 2021, surpassing the previous all-time high of 197 GW.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Energy deficit has reduced from 0.5% in Q1 FY21 to 0.3% in Q1 FY22, while the peak deficit has increased from 0.4% to 1.2% respectively and spurred improvement in merchant and short-term tariffs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Operating performance</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Average Plant Load Factor (PLF) achieved by APL and its subsidiaries during the first quarter of FY22 was 65%, as compared to 51% achieved in Q1 FY 21.&nbsp; Rise in PLF was a result of improved power demand in various States apart from better tariffs and volumes in the merchant and short-term markets.&nbsp; Consolidated Units sold for Q1 FY22 were 16.2 BU, as compared to the Q1 FY21 sales volume of 12.7 BU.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Financial performance</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Consolidated total revenue for Q1 FY22 stood higher at Rs. 7,213 Crore as compared to Rs. 5,356 Crore in Q1 FY21. The consolidated revenue for Q1 FY22 includes recognition of prior period net revenue from operations of Rs. 125 Crore and prior period Other Income of Rs. 532 Crore, primarily on account of various regulatory orders and delayed payments by DISCOMs. In comparison, prior period recognition amounted to Rs. 8 Crore as revenue from operations and Rs. (-) 5 Crore as Other Income in Q1 FY21.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Consolidated EBITDA for Q1 FY22 grew higher by 49% to Rs. 2,292 Crore as compared to Rs. 1,541 Crore for Q1 FY21. EBITDA for the quarter improved mainly due to higher volumes, improved merchant tariffs, and higher prior period income recognition, which was partially offset by higher import coal prices.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Finance costs for Q1 FY22 declined to Rs. 1,068 Crore as compared to Rs. 1,392 Crore in Q1 FY21 on account of conversion of unsecured loans into Unsecured Perpetual Securities during FY21, term loan repayment, interest rate reduction, and favourable currency movement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Profit Before Tax for Q1 FY22 was Rs. 450 Crore, as compared to loss of Rs. (-) 634 Crore in Q1 FY21.&nbsp; Profit After Tax for Q1 FY22 was Rs. 278 Crore, as compared to a loss of Rs. (-) 682 Crore in Q1 FY21. Total Comprehensive Income for Q1 FY22 was Rs. 270 Crore, as compared to Total Comprehensive Loss of Rs. (-) 705 Crore for Q1 FY 21.&nbsp;</p>
