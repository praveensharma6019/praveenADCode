        ;">We aim to continuously improve our climate governance. Recently, Adani Power Limited received assessment from CDP &ndash; the global environmental disclosure system &ndash; to measure the risks and opportunities on climate change as well as water security. The company has received a CDP score (Climate Change Score) of D which is a Disclosure band. This is as same as the Asia regional average of D, and lower than the thermal power generation sector average of B.  The company also received a C band (Water Security) which is an Awareness Band. This is lower than the Asia regional average of B, and lower than the thermal power generation sector average of B. These CDP Score Reports will enable us to progress towards our sustainability goals.
