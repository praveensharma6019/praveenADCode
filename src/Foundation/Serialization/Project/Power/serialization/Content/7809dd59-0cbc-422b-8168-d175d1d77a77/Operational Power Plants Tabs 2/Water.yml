        <p class="pl-4 mb-3">Mundra is India’s largest TPP to function off a sea-water based closed- cycle induced draft circulating cooling water system. The system draws on sea water that is recycled upto 4 times, conserving water & requiring a smaller discharge pipeline into the sea than an open- circuit cooling system.</p>
        					<p class="pl-4 mb-3">Though seawater is used for the cooling system, other Auxillary systems use sea water purified by a reverse osmosis plant, that can produce 47 Million litres of fresh water every day. Boilers require Demineralized water that is produced in Demineralization plants : Each 660 MW Boiler can convert more than 2000 MT of water per hour into Steam that is 250 times the atmospheric pressure & at a high of 566 Deg <sup>o</sup>C  steam is send to the turbine through high pressure pipes, after which it is collected & indirectly cooled in a condenser with sea water & recycled back to the boiler.</p>
