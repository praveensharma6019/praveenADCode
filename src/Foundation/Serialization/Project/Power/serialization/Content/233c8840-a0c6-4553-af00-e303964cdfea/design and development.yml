        <p class="pl-4">Our Mundra plant sets global benchmarks for power producers in terms of size, efficiency and sustainability. Despite its enormous capacity, the facility stands unique in the world when compared with area per MW. Located on a very optimized layout of 734 Acres alongside auxiliaries like cooling towers, 47 MLD desalination plant and flue gas desulfurization plant. India’s Central Electricity Authority allows for 0.5 Acre/MW of land, which for Mundra TPP could have meant 2310 Acres i.e. over three times its actual area..
        
        The plant was constructed in 36 months - A record among Indian power developers. The plant was also the first to introduce the 660 MW supercritical power technology to India with the commissioning of its Unit # 5 in December 2010 following installation of four 330 MW units. </p>
