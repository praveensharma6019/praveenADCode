        <p class="d-block">In line with the Adani Group’s vision to be a globally admired leader in the integrated
        infrastructure and transportation businesses, the Adani Group forayed into the airports sector
        in 2019. Adani Airports, the new business incubated within the group’s flagship company Adani
        Enterprises Ltd., won the mandate to modernize and operate six airports that are in
        Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram through a
        globally competitive tendering process conducted by the Airports Authority of India (AAI).
        Subsequently, Adani Airports received the Letter of Award (LoA) for all six airports -
        Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvananthapuram. On February
        14, 2020, the company signed the Concession Agreement (CA) for the three airports i.e. Sardar
        Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (Ahmedabad), Chaudhary Charan Singh International
        Airport (Lucknow) &amp; Mangaluru International Airport (Mangaluru). Adani Airports will operate,
        manage &amp; develop all these six airports for a period of 50 years.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #212529;">Adani Airports Commenced Operations in Mangaluru International Airport (Mangaluru) on 31st
        October 2020, Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport (Lucknow) on 2nd November 2020
        and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (Ahmedabad) on 7th November 2020.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #212529;">Adani Airports has taken over management control of Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL). This follows
        approvals received from the Government of India, the City and Industrial Development
        Corporation (CIDCO) of Maharashtra and the Government of Maharashtra.</span></p>
        
        <p><span style="color: #212529;">MIAL is India’s second busiest airport by both passenger and cargo traffic. With eight airports in
        its management and development portfolio, AAHL is now India&#39;s largest airport infrastructure
        company, accounting for 25% airport footfalls. With the addition of MIAL, AAHL will now also
        control 33% of India’s air cargo traffic.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #212529;">While the world navigates its way out of an unprecedented crisis, post-pandemic demand for air
        travel in India and the rest of the world is expected to surge. The International Air Transport
        Association expects global passenger traffic to recover to 88% of pre-COVID levels by 2022 and
        exceed pre-COVID levels in 2023.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #212529;">With India expected to be the world&#39;s third-largest aviation market by 2024, the addition of the
        Mumbai International Airport to the Adani Group’s existing portfolio and thereafter the
        operationalization of the greenfield Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited (NMIAL) provides
        a transformational aviation platform with several strategic adjacencies for the Group’s other
        B2B businesses and allows the Group to interlink its B2B and B2C business models. 
        This new international airport is expected to be fully operational in 2024.</span></p>
