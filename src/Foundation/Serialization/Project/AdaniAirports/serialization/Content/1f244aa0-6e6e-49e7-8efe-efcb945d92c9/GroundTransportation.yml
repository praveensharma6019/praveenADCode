        	<p>With our focus on customer centricity, streamlining the ground transportation to ensure a seamless experience through traffic flow planning and adequate parking is a priority.  Our airports have multi-modal connectivity through private vehicles, metro (where feasible), metered taxis, cars on rent, inter-city and intra-city bus services, and we shall provide services for all these including right priced commercial offerings.  </p>
