          <h3>Engineering: Providing value to Business</h3>
        				<p class="mb-3">Adani Infra has a strong engineering team having vast experience in all aspects of thermal and solar power projects from concept to commissioning. Specialist engineers at Adani Infra have conceptualized and commissioned India’s first super-critical unit of 660 MW. As on date, they have engineered 4 units of 330MW and 12 units of 660 MW. Adani Infra is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and tools in engineering & design work.</p>
        				<p class="mb-3">Adani Infra is in advance stage of deploying additional tools for Slope Stability Analysis, Geo Tech, PDS, 3D review and ETAP. Key strength areas of engineering include thermal power plants, solar power plants, front end engineering for new business ventures, equipment sizing, material handling and water system including water retaining structures. Special structure and works capability of Adani Infra include chimney, intake well, site levelling & grading, roads & drains, township and engineering using Chinese structural steel sections.</p>
        				<p class="mb-3">Creativity is a motivational force for Adani Infraengineers. At Adani Infra, it is used as ainnovation tool to bring out the best of ideas, brainstorm within teams, study in details through case studies and evolve a concept for improvising the existing systems / principles for implementation, which have the potential benefits either in terms of cost, operation and execution. The output, coined as, “Value Engineering” is a continuous process within Adani Infra as Engineering Group.</p>
