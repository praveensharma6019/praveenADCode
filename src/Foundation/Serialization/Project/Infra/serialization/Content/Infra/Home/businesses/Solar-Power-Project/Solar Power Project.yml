        <h3>Bitta Solar Power Plant</h3>
        						<p>To appreciate Adani’s vision of nation building, Adani Infra (India) Ltd. executed the largest Solar Photovoltaic thin-film Technology project of 40 MWp Capacity in Bitta in Gujarat's Kutch district in December 2011 to empower one and all with clean, green power that is accessible and affordable for faster and higher socio-economic development.</p>
        						<p>Adani Group leverages on AIIL’s expertise in offering integrated power solution under a single roof, world-wide network for engineering, international supply chain management and top-class project management skills and expertise in construction management.</p>
        						<p>40 MWp Solar Bitta Solar power plant was commissioned in a record time of five months. The project activity consists of amorphous Silicon thin-film modules of 100/95 Wp capacity and spread over 350 acres of land. Over 4 lacs thin-film PV modules are mounted on approx. 21700 Mounting Structures, to generate total 40 MWp Capacity. The total electricity generation from the project is more than 63.8 million units for the first year.</p>
        							<p>Now on stream with reliability and efficiency, this Solar PV Power Plant is a testimony of Adani Group’s commitment to Alternative Energy Resources and a benchmark to provide pollution-free renewable energy to the community.</p>
