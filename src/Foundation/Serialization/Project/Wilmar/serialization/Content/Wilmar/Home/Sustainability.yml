            <h3>Sustainable Sourcing</h3><p>Responsible sourcing and supply chain transformation has always been a strategic priority for Adani
        Wilmar. To meet our sustainability commitments, we ensure that our supply chain works towards the
        same sustainability standards that our founding partner upholds. We are committed to creating a
        traceable and transparent supply chain. Traceability allows us to map our supply chain and gain in-depth
        knowledge on the origins of our raw materials, which is fundamentally important for the implementation
        of our sustainability commitments within our supply chain. At the same time, supply chain traceability
        allows us to identify the suppliers linked to our operations, thus enabling us to develop ongoing
        partnerships for improvements while monitoring compliance against our sustainability commitments.</p>

To this extent, we benchmark our internal operations against various national and international sustainability standards and certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to support the flow of sustainable palm oil and its derivatives into the India market.</p>

        		<p>Achieving responsible operations is core to our business philosophy. We are driven to explore and implement sustainable solutions that reduce the adverse impact on the environment, health and safety of our people. Our focus is to create brands and products that are not only preferred by consumers but also those that conserve resources, protect the environment, and improve living conditions for those who need it the most. We adopt a two-pronged approach for moving forward in the direction of achieving responsible operations.</p>
            <h3>Environment</h3><p>Green Manufacturing is at the heart of our environmental stewardship - Our business relies on water, energy, and other resources to operate and remains committed to the efficient use of these resources. We acknowledge the important role that we play in minimizing the environmental footprint of our operations and supporting sustainable production. We implement efficiency measures to reduce our energy and water use and, where possible, we reuse, recover, and recycle waste. We also strive to responsibly manage disposed waste, effluents, and chemicals.</p>

            <h3>Consumer Recycling</h3> <h6 style="    font-weight: bold;    padding-bottom: 10px;">Use of Recyclable Packaging Material</h6><p>In researching and developing sustainable packaging solutions, we want to ensure that we do not compromise on product safety and quality. Adani Wilmar pioneered the introduction of recyclable packaging for edible oil pouches within the industry in India. Following the flagship launch of our brand Fortune in March 2018, the company has sourced for plastic films comprising of a novel formulation of polyethylene (PE) resins to create a new, sustainable packaging. The novel formulation of polyethylene (PE) resin has already been certified by the Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET).</p>
        	<h6 style="    font-weight: bold;    padding-bottom: 10px;">Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)</h6>
        <p>Adani Wilmar has an action plan to comply with Plastic Waste Management Rules and has signed agreements with multiple agencies for ensuring the plastic waste collection including both Multi-Layered Plastic (MLP) & Non-Multilayered Plastic (Non-MLP) across the nation.</p>
        <p>Since inception of EPR in 2019, the company has successfully collected 21,000 MT till date and plans are afoot to gradually scale up the targets to match the 100% and collect back all of it from the market and send it for authorized Recyclers in the country. This is best achieved through a co-operative effort, which encourages a sense of stake-holding in the entire process right from waste generation, primary collection, segregation, recycling, and final disposal.</p>

In view of below par Nutrition level prevailing in our country, Adani Wilmar set upon a journey of putting the words- “For A Healthy Growing Nation” into action by launching Fortune SuPoshan Project in association with Adani Foundation.</p>  <p class="mt-4" style="
