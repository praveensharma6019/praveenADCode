        <p class="mb-3 pl-4 d-block">In the fiscal year 2013, we forayed into food products with a focus on staple foods. We offer a variety of packaged staple foods, including wheat flour, rice, besan and pulses. Many of the staple foods we offer include different variants. For example, we provide basic wheat flour, refined wheat flour and granulated wheat, including rawa and suji. We offer both basmati rice and non-basmati rice in different grain sizes. We also offer packaged sugar. </p>
        <p class="mb-3 pl-4 d-none">In addition, we leverage our soya crushing capacities to offer (i) soya chunks, which is a textured vegetable protein we offer in consumer packs. We started to offer soya chunks, which are high in protein, in the fiscal year 2015; and (ii) a series of soya value-added products derived from soybeans, including soya flour, soya grits, soya flakes and soya bari </p>
        <p class="mb-3 pl-4 d-none">We also introduced soya chunkies as ready-to-cook product with three different flavors. In the fiscal year 2020, we launched ready-to-cook khichdi, which is a combination of rice, pulses and other grains. We offer khichdi with three different flavors (Punjabi, Gujarati and Bengali) from three different regions of India. </p>
        <p class="mb-3 pl-4 d-none">Our packaged foods are offered under “Fortune”, our flagship brand, as well as “Jubilee” and “Golden Chef” as masstige brands.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3 pl-4 d-none">We started to offer soaps under our “Alife” brand in the fiscal year 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced handwash and sanitizers under our “Alife” brand in the fiscal year 2021. </p>
