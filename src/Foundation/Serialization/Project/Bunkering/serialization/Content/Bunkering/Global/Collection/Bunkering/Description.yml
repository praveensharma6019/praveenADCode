        <p class="d-block">We are India’s leading bunker supplier supported by the infrastructure strength of Adani Group, which has helped us in offering bunkering services at Indian Ports. Presently, we are a physical bunker supplier in Gujarat with world-class infrastructure at Mundra Port. Bunker supplies to other Indian ports are made in association with state-owned oil companies. We own and operate a fleet of barges of various sizes to match different products, locations and sizes of the receiving vessels.</p>
