        <p class="mb-3">I joined Adani Group in 2016 as an engineering graduate trainee in its upcoming renewable energy business. The Group is always setting benchmarks in whichever businesses it forays into and renewable energy is a very promising sector. So, while I was thrilled to get an opportunity to work in this vertical, I was also slightly nervous. From then – when I arrived in Mundra and the first solar manufacturing plant was still under construction – to now, it’s safe to say that my career has grown alongside the business. </p>

        <p class="mb-3">The solar PV manufacturing began in November 2016 and the core responsibility of my team was to set-up different processes and quality control measures. A solar panel must have longevity and hence the quality becomes extremely crucial. My role is to ensure that all the quality parameters and process controls that we as a team have set up, not only match the industry standards but also help the final product to be of the highest quality. It was also my team’s responsibility to ensure complete adherence to the parameters and controls which were put in place. </p>

        <p class="mb-3">I was very happy when in a record time of 12-18 months, we achieved the Top Performer rankings by DNV-GL PVEL Global reliability testing in 2018. We have won this award 3 years in a row, making Adani the only solar manufacturer in India to have achieved this feat. Within this context, my personal growth as a professional has also been immense. Today, with 6 years of experience, I am the youngest Associate Manager at Adani Group. It shows that if you have the potential, the Group will give you the right opportunities to achieve more and more, and then some more! </p>

The scope of growth and the constant feeling of pride that you are making a difference to not just the company but to the country and the environment is immensely fulfilling. I may just be a small spoke in the giant wheel of renewable energy, but I am very proud that I am contributing to the cause of reducing the overall carbon footprint. I am helping India achieve its goal of generating 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and that is incredibly gratifying.  </p>
