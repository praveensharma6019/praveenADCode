        <p class="mb-3">I was born and raised in Kurukshetra but have spent much of my life in the NCR belt. Hence, when I got the opportunity to work for Adani at their Ahmedabad Headquarters, I was both excited and skeptical. I live with my wife and two children, and accepting the offer meant a shift for the entire family. I have an experience of over 20 years where I have worked with a variety of multinational corporations and multi-billion-dollar businesses. However, the opportunity I had at Adani was too good to pass up. The group’s diverse portfolio, with multiple verticals, provided me with varied roles and responsibilities, something I always desired. Taking the leap of faith, I decided to accept the offer.</p>

        <p class="mb-3">I relocated to Ahmedabad in early 2021, when things were still haywire because of COVID-19. But thanks to the support from our Human Resources team, this transition was made quite smooth for me as well as my family! From the day I decided to join till the time I reached Shantigram, Ahmedabad, someone from the organization was constantly in touch with me. Always being just a call away, the team really made it so easy for me to get started and become a part of the ‘Adani Parivar’, as they call it! Care that’s heart-felt, a sense of warmth and abundant opportunity to do more  is how I would sum up my initial impressions!</p>

        <p class="mb-3 mt-3 mt-lg-0">On my first day at the office, I recall meeting the CEO, the leadership team, and every member of my team, all of whom were very welcoming. A sense of positivity filled me. At Adani, we are constantly committed invest in technological advancement. One of our current endeavors is to leverage Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Extended Reality for our core business operations. I am proud to be a part of a team that is pushing the boundaries to achieve something that no company has ever imagined. At the end of the day, I go home with the satisfaction that I am a part of something big, something that would change the course of business in the coming years.</p>

        <p class="mb-3">I knew Adani Corporate House was in Shantigram, but I couldn’t imagine it being so close that I could walk to work every day. After spending most of my life in government colonies, living in Shantigram is a significant improvement. Surrounded by nature in all directions, simply breathing in the fresh air makes me feel much younger and healthier. This has also given me a lot of free time. Previously, commuting back and forth from work took nearly 2-3 hours of the day, but now it only takes 15 minutes. This gives me the freedom to strike a much-needed work-life balance. I now have more time to spend with my family. We eat lunch together, take evening walks, and play games. I also rediscovered interests and hobbies that I had to abandon due to time constraints. I have started reading more books and playing golf. All of this would have felt like a dream a few years ago, but taking the leap of faith enabled me to make this dream a reality.</p>
        <p class="mb-5 mt-lg-0 mt-3">Looking back, joining Adani and relocating to Ahmedabad were unquestionably the two best decisions I've ever made.</p>
