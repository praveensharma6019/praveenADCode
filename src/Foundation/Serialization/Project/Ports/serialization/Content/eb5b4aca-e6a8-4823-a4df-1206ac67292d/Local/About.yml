Other bulk cargo and containers continue to register double digit growth and this trend should continue in years to come. While West coast continues to register double digit growth in containers, east coast specifically Dhamra has huge potential to grow exponentially. We would continue to increase our footprints in Logistics space and further improve our port to hinterland connectivity. We would thus aim to become a truly fully integrated player providing end to end service to our customers</p>
