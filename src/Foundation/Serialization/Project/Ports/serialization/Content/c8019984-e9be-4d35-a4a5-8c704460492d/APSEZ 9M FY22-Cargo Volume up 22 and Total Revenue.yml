        <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p><em>&nbsp;</em>In Q3 FY22, cargo volume was subdued on account of lower import of coal by key IPPs like Adani Power Mundra, GGPL and lower trading coal volume which was impacted due to higher commodity prices and disruptions in the supply chain. Coal volume in Q4 FY22 is likely to improve due to increasing power demand and softening of prices Globally.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">&nbsp;&ldquo;APSEZ had shown tremendous resilience all through the pandemic period,&rdquo; said <strong>Mr Karan Adani, Chief Executive Officer and Whole Time Director of APSEZ</strong>. &ldquo;Our learnings in 2020 helped us weather the storm and our operational expertise allowed us to continue our expansion. The addition of two ports in 2021 &ndash; Krishnapatnam and Gangavaram in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast of India &ndash; to the ones on the west coast continued to tighten our pan-India presence. Our under-construction port of Vizhinjam in Kerala, along with our new terminal in Colombo, Sri Lanka, will act as a new transshipment hub in southeast Asia.&rdquo;</p>
        <p class="mt-3">&ldquo;Our carbon offsetting, mangrove afforestation and terrestrial plantation, as well as our extensive focus on the use of renewable energies, have meant that APSEZ is well on the road to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 and becoming the world&rsquo;s most sustainable ports company,&rdquo; added <strong>Mr Karan Adani.</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-3">&nbsp;The Adani Group&rsquo;s progress in firming up its Transport Utility model is a recognition that transport infrastructure performs as essential a function as electricity. This transport utility model was further augmented by the expansion in the rail network and Grade-A warehousing capacity, as well as by further investments in logistics capabilities. The Adani Group will continue to invest in new technologies, automation and digitization, to provide further impetus for growth.</p>
