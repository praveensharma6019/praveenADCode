The location of GPL in the north of AP is a strategic complement to our recent acquisition of the Port of Krishnapatnam that serves the south of AP. We believe that GPL holds great potential to complement its bulk cargo terminals with new cargo catagories that we intend to develop. The port provides us great access to an adjacent hinterland that was largely untapped by APSEZ thereby placing us in a position to serve a broader set of port customers as well as expand our overall hinterland logistics footprint for a much larger base of customers. We are grateful to the leaders of the AP Government for their support and are committed to doing our part to support their vision of accelerating the industrialization of AP. The Raju family must be complimented for having built an absolute world class asset that we are proud to invest in.&rdquo;</span></p>
