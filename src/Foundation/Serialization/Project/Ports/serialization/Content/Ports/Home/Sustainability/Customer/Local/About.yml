This involves smooth coordination and seamless integration amongst multiple functions and across levels within the organization. However, this is easier said than done, especially when the organization grows to become a behemoth like ours. In order to manage the business and operations effectively, IT has proven to be a saviour. IT has become an integral part of our lives to such an extent that we do not even realize its significance in routine work.
