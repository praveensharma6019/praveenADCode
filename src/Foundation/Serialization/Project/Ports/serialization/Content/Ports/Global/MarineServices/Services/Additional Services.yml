        <p class="mb-3">APSEZL has been steadily increasing its maintenance dredging capability over the past few years. We operate a multitude of maintenance dredging equipment which includes a Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger, a Water Injection Dredger, a self-propelled grab dredger, dumb grab dredgers and a special dredger for under-berth dredging.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">The above equipment is capable of handling different siltation patterns at our ports along the coastline of India. For example,</p>
        <ul class="ul-circle">
            <li>the WID was built indigenously specifically for handling the floating silt situations at our ports and</li>
            <li>the specialized dredger was built to handle specific berthing problems in Dhamra.</li>
        </ul>
