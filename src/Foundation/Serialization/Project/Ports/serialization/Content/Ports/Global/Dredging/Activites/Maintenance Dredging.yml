        		<p class="mb-3">APSEZL has been steadily increasing its maintenance dredging capability over the past few years. We operate a multitude of maintenance dredging equipment which includes 3 Trailing Suction Hopper Dredgers, a Water Injection Dredger, Grab dredgers and a special dredger for under-berth dredging.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">The above equipment is capable of handling all types of maintenance dredging requirements to counter different siltation patterns at ports. </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Our latest addition of sister vessels of 8000 cum have proved themselves to be highly efficient dredgers with successful external maintenance dredging projects already executed at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, Jaigarh Port, Angre Port, PLL-Dahej, Southern Naval Command- Kochi Port, etc., besides meeting our internal requirements.</p>
