                    <p class="mb-2">
        In light of recent allegations against the Adani Group, in wake of the on-going Farm Bill protest, we would like to clarify some factual inaccuracies.</p>
        <p class="mb-2">
        Firstly, our website clearly says that we invested INR 700 Cr. to build our Silo Grain Storage infrastructure. This project was envisaged by GOI under the National Policy on Bulk Handling, Storage & Transportation in 2000. Global tenders were invited by the Food Corporation of India in 2003. The Adani Group being the most competitive, was awarded the contract in 2005. The project was commissioned in 2007 for a concession period of 20 years. Therefore, it is important to understand the fact that the project came up in 2007 and is successfully serving its purpose for the last 13 years. But some motivated elements with an agenda to hold back India's development are misrepresenting facts stating that the Adani Group was gifted funds from the ruling government to set up this project.</p> 
        <p class="mb-2">
        	Secondly, given our legacy of operational excellence, the Adani Group has worked with existing and earlier government to fortify our facilities' footprints in Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, WB, Bihar, UP etc. All the Silo projects are awarded to the company by the FCI on a competitive bidding basis. Apart from the Adani Group, there are over 10 more companies who are working with FCI in this field. All such projects come up only under the guidelines of the Ministry.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-3" />	Most essentially facts are being misrepresented citing the strategic growth of our Ports & Logistics portfolio. For the record, Adani Agri Logistics Ltd. (AALL) was established in 2005 much earlier than the ruling government came into power. The Adani Group's legacy stands testament of working towards national goals with multiple governments over the past 3 decades. AALL was acquired by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd from Adani Enterprises Limited, the flagship company of the Adani Group in 2018-19. The acquisition was a part of APSEZ's vision to become Ports to end-to-end Logistics Company in India.
        	<p class="mb-2" />We appeal to the people of this nation to see through this motivated mandate to defame the Adani Group and challenge India's growth vision for political gains. <p />
