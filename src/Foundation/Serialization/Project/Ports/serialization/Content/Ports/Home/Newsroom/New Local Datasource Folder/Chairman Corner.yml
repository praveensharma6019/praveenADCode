      Hint: Description
      Value: "First, the organization gets a set goal - to aim to be number one - and that by itself is motivating for the team to rally round a precise objective. Second, the scale that emerges by thinking big drives solutions that otherwise may have seemed infeasible or uneconomical. And third and most importantly, such vision helps attract the type of people that get excited by the massive challenges that many businesses would not even consider"

      Hint: Summary
      Value: A key principle that drives Mr. Adani's thinking is that, if anything is worth doing, then it should be done on a global scale and given India's rapid growth, the way to build global scale is to use India as the launching pad.
