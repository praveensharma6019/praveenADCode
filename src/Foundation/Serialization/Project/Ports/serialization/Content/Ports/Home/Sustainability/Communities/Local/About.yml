        <p class="mb-3 d-block">The Adani Foundation has been striving to create sustainable opportunities for the marginalized communities for over two decades now. Today, it is reaching out to 2,315 villages in 18 States across India by facilitating quality education, sustainable livelihood development, promoting a healthy society and supporting rural infrastructure development. Besides these four core areas, the foundation implements four special projects, namely Saksham, Swachhagraha, SuPoshan, Udaan.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-block">The success story of Adani Foundation is crafted through sustainable behavioural change in communities who have taken ownership of the initiatives. Read on to get a glimpse.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-block">To make education available and affordable to as many children as possible, the foundation runs several cost-free and subsidized schools. This includes Adani Vidya Mandir (Ahmedabad and Bhadreshwar), Adani DAV Public School (Dhamra) and Navchetan Vidyala (Junagam). A project to adopt government primary schools called &lsquo;Utthan&rsquo; is being run in remote areas of Mundra, Nakhatrana and Hazira in Gujarat. In this project, students who are lagging behind academically are tutored by supplementary teachers called Utthan Sahayaks and attention is also paid to enhance the staff&rsquo;s teaching capabilities. Under project Udaan, exposure tour is organized for school and college students at Adani Group's business establishments in Mundra and Hazira in Gujarat, Tirora in Maharashtra, Kawai in Rajasthan, Dhamra in Odisha and Udupi in Karnataka. </p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-none">Bringing healthcare to remotest of regions is Adani Foundation&rsquo;s key focus. In this pursuit, it runs GAIMS &ndash; the only Medical College and Multi-Specialty Modern District Hospital in Kutch District. It also runs several Mobile Health Care Units (MHCUs) and organizes general as well as specialized health camps. Another significant step in this direction is providing special support to the elderly through senior citizen health cards under the Vadil Swasthya Yojana. The foundation also inaugurated the Adani Foundation Dhamra Ports Wellness Centre in December 2019. A special project aiding the health and well-being of the community is Fortune SuPoshan, alleviating malnutrition and anaemia in children, adolescent girls, pregnant women and new mothers.</p>
        <p class="mb-3  d-none">The Adani Foundation builds social capital by promoting self-help groups, supporting initiatives towards preservation of traditional art and organizing skill development training. Among the many unique initiatives to make women self-reliant is Vizmart in Vizhinjam, Kerala. It is a market outlet comprising 14 shops run by women from the communities in the periphery of the Vizhinjam Port. In Mundra, various women&rsquo;s Self-Help Groups have been created to train, educate and empower women with job opportunities in government sectors. The Adani Skill Development Centres (ASDC) in the region are training disadvantaged groups like young widowed women to become Patient Care Assistants who have been successfully placed in various reputed hospitals. It also trains differently-abled (divyang) population and supports them with equipment needed for them to become financially independent. ASDC has played a crucial role in the revival of SUF &amp; Namda handicrafts in Mundra. </p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-none">When it comes to community infrastructure development, the Adani Foundation makes is activities need specific and responsive to the grassroots&rsquo; requirements. It supports infrastructural requirements in schools and by way of installing street lights, building community halls etc. Another importance aspect in this regard is fulfilling the community&rsquo;s water requirements. The foundation&rsquo;s water conservation activities first took shape in Mundra, in the water-scarce and drought prone Kutch district of Gujarat. The Rooftop Rain Water Harvesting and Recharge Bore-Well Project created a valuable water source for use throughout the year by artificially recharging the percolation well and ultimately increasing groundwater level.</p>
        <p class="mb-3 d-none">Another great project delivered for the community is one that promotes sustainable waste management practices at community places in Vizhinjam. This is by installation of 26 Thumboormuzhi Aerobins which were completed and handed over to Trivandrum Municipal Corporation. Each bin has a capacity to treat 1.5 tonnes of organic waste.</p>
