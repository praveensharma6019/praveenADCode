        <p /><p><strong>Ahmedabad, India, April 25, 2017</strong>>: Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), India’s leading port infrastructure developer and part of the Adani Group, today achieved a new milestone in the ports infrastructure industry in India, with a strategic collaboration with CMA Terminals (CMAT) - part of the France based CMA CGM group, owner of one of the world’s leading Container Carriers and port operators.</p>
        
        <p />
        <br />
        <p>Pursuant to a Joint Venture agreement signed in July 2014 between APSEZ and CMAT, today marked a watershed moment, when these two conglomerates operationalised the new container terminal named Adani CMA Mundra Terminal Private Limited (ACMTPL).</p>
        
        <p />
        <br />
        <p>The establishment of this brand new state-of-the-art container terminal offers India's trade with another world class facility on the West coast of India, strategically located in closer proximity to the vast North and Central Indian hinterlands. The relatively advantageous location has made Mundra port ideally poised to position itself as the major gateway port for the India’s western coast.</p>
        
        <p />
        <br />
        <p>This new container terminal, which is now operational has been commissioned three months ahead of schedule, &nbsp;will serve to showcase the strengthening national ties between Indian and French economies and is a great initiative between a leading India conglomerate and global shipping and ports company.</p>
        
        <p />
        <br />
        <p>Speaking on this momentous occasion, Mr Karan Adani, CEO, APSEZ, stated that “This is a notable milestone for us, as with the commissioning of this terminal, Mundra port will become India’s largest container-handling port. This strategic partnership with CMA CGM in the Container Terminals business brings significant value to Mundra port. By virtue of their position of the world’s third largest container shipping line, CMA CGM is a valuable customer for Mundra port; and with this strategic partnership, they will become a valuable partner, leaving them ideally poised to participate in the ever increasing share of global EXIM trade handled through the port of Mundra.”</p>
        
        <p />
        <br />
        <p>“With this new development, Mundra port is perfectly primed to set the bar even higher on the crucial parameters of efficiency, productivity and faster turnaround times for larger vessels, which will directly translate into competitive advantages for our customers. Mundra port continues to be conscious of its environmental responsibilities and has installed world class equipment, which vastly reduces air and noise pollution. With this partnership, APSEZ has further consolidated its position as the port of choice for major shipping lines and firmly established itself as a key player in the regional container market,” he added. </p>
        
        <p />
        
        <p />
        <br />
        <p>The completion of the ACMTPL project makes Mundra Port the largest container-handling port in the country, as well as the country’s foremost multi-purpose port facility. ACMTPL will be capable of handling the world’s largest container ships. </p>
        
        <p />
        <br />
        <p>ACMTPL has four units of 65 tonnes capacity of Rail Mounted Quay Cranes capable of handling 18,000 TEU vessels and Super Post and Ultra Large Container Vessels and an annual capacity of 1.3 million TEUs. &nbsp;The yard equipment includes twelve 41 tonne lift rubber tyred container gantry cranes, which will accommodate seven rows of containers and one operational lane.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The terminal spans over 27 hectares, with a 650-meter long quay and a draft of 16.5 meters. </p>
        <br />
        <p>APSEZ continues to rapidly expand its container terminals footprint across India’s coastline and further augments APSEZ’s existing three container handling facilities at Mundra, Hazira and Kattupalli, an under construction transhipment hub in Vizinjham in Kerala and two other under construction terminals at Ennore in Tamil Nadu and Dhamra in Odisha. It will allow Adani Ports to fulfil its stated vision of handling 200 million metric tonnes of cargo well before the year 2020.</p>
        <br />
        <p>For CMA CGM, ACMTPL is its first port investment in India, and demonstrates its ambition to further increase its presence in this strategic and fast-developing country. CMA CGM is present in India since 1984. With around 4,000 staff members and 29 offices, it is calling 13 ports in India, and offers to its Indian customers 11 direct weekly shipping services connecting India to Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. This new investment adds to the 27 container terminals that CMA CGM has today in its portfolio, and is a key step in its strategy to further expand its position in port operations.</p>
        <br />
        <p>CMA CGM offers in India a wide range of shipping and intermodal solutions covering accessibility to and from 51 inland locations, 6 gateway ports and 7 feeder ports in the country. The company offers connections to its port terminals through dedicated block trains.</p>
