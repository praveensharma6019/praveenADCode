        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Ahmedabad, February 10, 2015:</span></strong> Adani Ports &amp; Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), India&rsquo;s largest port developer and part of Adani Group, a global integrated player, today said it had commissioned a bulk terminal at Tuna Tekra, Kanda Port, with an annual handling capacity of over 20 million tonnes, further consolidating its leadership one position on the west coast of India.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Mr Nitin Gadkari, the Honourable Minister for Shipping, Road Transport and Highways inaugurated the terminal after the berthing of the project&rsquo;s first vessel MV Sheng Ming earlier in the day.</p>
        <br />
        <p>&ldquo;The Tuna Tekra terminal is yet another feather in the Adani cap. We expect the terminal to be a game-changer for Export Import trade of the Northwest hinterland of India, thanks to its strategic location. Add to it Adani Group&rsquo;s infrastructural prowess, speed of execution and operational efficiencies,&rdquo; said Mr Karan Adani, Executive Director, APSEZ.</p>
        <br />
        <p>&ldquo;It is a proud moment for us at Adani as we commission the Tuna Tekra dry bulk terminal. The port facility is our fourth in Gujarat and fifth on the entire western coast. Its commissioning marks the further consolidation of our leadership in the port infrastructure sector in India. This new facility will play a crucial role in the Make In India campaign. We are now aiming to complete the container terminal project in Chennai in a record time frame,&rdquo; said Mr. Sudipta Bhattacharya, CEO, APSEZ.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The consortium led by APSEZ, formed a SPV named Adani Kandla Bulk Terminal Pvt. Ltd (AKBTPL) after winning the contract in June 2012 to set up the bulk terminal. The terminal was completed within the stipulated time frame. The dry bulk cargo handling terminal facilities includes a T shaped jetty with four bulk berths, a vessel handling capacity of 1,00,000 DWT with (-) 16.2 m CD dredged depth and a capacity of 20 MMTPA.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The project is expected to benefit the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh amongst others. It is connected to the National Highway grid through NH-8A coming from Ahmedabad via Wankaner, Morbi and terminates at the Kandla Port.</p>
        <br />
        <p>APSEZ also operates ports in Mundra, Hazira and Dahej, in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha and operates specialized coal handling facilities in Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatinam in Andhra Pradesh. It is currently setting up a container terminal in Ennore, Chennai.</p>
