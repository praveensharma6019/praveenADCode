        <p><b>Mr. Karan Adani, Chief Executive Officer and Whole Time Director of APSEZ </b>said “APSEZ continues to gain market share due to strategy of having multi commodity ports across key locations. Our market share in H1 FY20 has increased by 100 bps to 22% of all India cargo volume and to 35% of all India container volume. </p><br />
        <p>Though Q2 of FY20 was subdued container volume continues to be strong. We expect H2FY20 to be better and confident of achieving 224-228 MMT of cargo throughput in FY20. </p><br />
        <p>With the recent cut in Repo rate, corporate tax reduction and resolve of the Government to accelerate economic growth, we expect economy to revive from Q1FY21. With our pan India presence and ability to handle all types of cargo at all our ports, we are best placed to capture the revival in Indian economy and are confident of achieving 10 to 12% CAGR cargo volume growth for the next few years.    </p><br />
        <p>
        Automation and use of technology to handle cargo, sweating of enhanced capacity and better cargo mix will continue to drive margin expansion. We believe sustainable development as a core value for our business future proofing. Protecting our environment, creating and maintaining safe operating environment and adopting best corporate practices will continue to be our focus areas”.
