                                        <p class="txt-xs">The location of the port, about 25 km from Surat, gives a strategic advantage to the port operator in terms of rail connectivity. Surat is located on the main broad gauge rail route between Delhi and Mumbai that caters to the key Delhi – JNPT container traffic. This rail route is double track, fully electrified and designed for fast trains. Private siding operated by M/s. KRIBHCO joins the Mumbai-Delhi line and extends for about 20 Kms. Hazira Port is about 21 Kms away from the KRIBHCO siding. Efforts are currently underway to develop better rail connectivity to the port.</p>

Expansion to four / six lanes of all major feeder roads is currently on and transportation to and from Hazira will be greatly facilitated.</p>
