            <li>AALL handles 5,75,000 MT of food grain for FCI in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and West Bengal. Another 3,00,000 MT of food grain is handled for Govt. of Madhya Pradesh.

        <p class="mb-3">Wheat is stored in GI Sheet (Steel) silos. The silos are fully covered and have an elaborate system for preservation of wheat.The most important features of the facility are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="ul-bullets">
            <li>Central Control System using state-of-the-art PLC systems, for automatic operations of the facility.</li>
            <li>High-end monitoring equipment for checking critical quality parameters like moisture content, foreign matter, live infestation etc.</li>
            <li>Modern cleaning and drying operations, through sieves, magnetic separators etc. to remove dust, tailings and other foreign matter.</li>
            <li>Silos are equipped with temperature monitoring system. In case the temperature inside the silos increases, the automatic aeration system starts functioning.</li>
            <li>Insect monitoring system helps in switching on the advanced fumigation system for preservation of the food grains. The phosphine generator uniformly distributes phosphine inside the silos in case of infestation; this ensures that the wheat is free from insects.</li>
            <li>Fire hydrant systems, superior material handling systems, full security cover, watch towers and wireless systems. </li>

            <li>The transportation of the stored food grain is in specially designed covered wagons, capable of handling bulk food grains (which are top loading and bottom discharge). </li>
            <li>Adani Agri Logistics has procured seven rakes, each consisting of 50 wagons. </li>
            <li>The automatic wagon loading system allows loading of one full rake in less than five hours, without involving manual labor. </li>
            <li>The bulk transportation in these wagons ensures minimal transit losses.</li>
            <li>The food grain transported from the base depots is stored at the field depots with similar preservation and storage facilities, in bulk form. Then they are delivered to FCI both in bulk and bagged form as per the requirements at the field depots. </li>
