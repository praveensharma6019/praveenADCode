        I have found that cycle number printed on my bill is changed. What is the reason?
        </div>
        <div id="ans2" class="accordion-body collapse show" data-parent="#formsList">
        <p>Ans: To serve you better we have reorganized billing cycles over 7 Divisions with effect from March-21 bill month. Some of the customer accounts may be reorganized while others remain in the same billing   Since your account has been reorganized in new billing cycle, new cycle no. appears in your bill. </p>

        Will this new cycle no. impact my bill amount?
        </div>
        <div id="ans3" class="ans collapse" data-parent="#formsList">
        <p>Ans: In few cases where billing is done for &lt; 28 days or where billing is done for &gt; 32 days, proration in slabs is effected so that you will get applicable slab benefits. It will not impact your tariff however bill amount may vary basis number of days you have been billed.</p>
        <p>Since the cycle change is effected only for this month the billing slabs are apportioned as per billing days. For example, if your bill is for 33 days, existing billing slabs are prorated accordingly, to adjust the slab benefits. Refer following table as an example:</p>
