        <span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>It appears on your bill when the meter cabin or the premises was locked and it was not possible to read the meter. In this case, the customer gets a bill based on last three month's bill. When the actual meter reading is taken, adjustments are made in the subsequent bill.
