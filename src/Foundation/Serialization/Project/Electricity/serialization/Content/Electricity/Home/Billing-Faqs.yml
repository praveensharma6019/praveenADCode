        <p>Due to Covid-19 pandemic meter reading was discontinued and has been gradually resumed from June-20 onwards.</p>
        <p>As per MERC practice directions (click <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.adanielectricity.com/Important-Covid-19-Update" target="_blank">here</a> to know more) we have billed you for the interim two billing cycles based upon your trailing three months average consumption, which pertains to the winter period.</p>
        <p>Upon obtaining the actual reading in June, the billing for the period has been amended and actual units have been uniformly allocated for the entire three-month period. This actual billing for the period is reduced by the estimated bills to provide the difference amount between actual and estimated bills.</p>
        <p>Any payment made by you during the period is also adjusted while revising the billing for the period as per your actual reading.</p>
        <p>Your May-2020 bill raised in June therefore includes the consumption of May-20 as well as differential consumption over estimation of March-20 and April-20.</p>

        <p>Further, the following practice directions are issued by the Hon&rsquo;ble Commission, on 09/05/2020, in respect of billing to electricity consumers during lockdown period: </p>
        <p><strong>A.	Fixed Charges Moratorium for Commercial &amp; Industrial Consumers</strong><br />
        For Industrial &amp; Commercial consumers, the recovery of fixed/demand charges applicable for 3 months moratorium period are as follows:
        a)	To be recovered in equal interest free instalments in subsequent three billing cycles.<br />
        b)	If you pay the entire amount of 3 months moratorium period upfront in a single payment, the rebate of 1% shall be given.
        </p>
        <p><strong>B.	Assessed/Estimated Billing where actual meter reading is not available</strong><br />
        For consumers, whose actual reading is not available, assessed billing procedure is as follows:<br />
        a.	Token amount (10% of the average energy consumption of past 3 months) to be billed to Industrial &amp; Commercial premises that are under lockdown.<br />
        b.	In case, the amount paid by you based on the assessed billing is higher than that payable as per actual reading (when taken), the holding charge (equivalent to 1-month MCLR rate of SBI as on billing date) on excess amount paid shall be credited to the consumer.<br />
        c.	In case, the amount paid by you based on the assessed billing is lower than that payable as per actual reading (when taken), carrying cost (equivalent to 1-month MCLR rate of SBI as on billing date) shall be levied on your account. To avoid carrying cost, you can voluntarily pay any amount over &amp; above assessed bill which would be adjusted when billing based on actual reading is undertaken post lockdown period.
        </p>
        <p><strong>C.	Delayed Payment Charge (DPC)</strong><br />
        1)	If you have paid &ge; 80% of the bill amount, Delay Payment Charges (DPC) on unpaid amount will be reduced to 50%
        E.g. if the bill amount is 2000/- &amp; if customer has paid &gt;80% i.e. 1650 then DPC is charged as 0.65% (50% of normal charge of 1.25%) on balance amount <br />
        So DPC would be (2000-1650) *0.65%= Rs. 2.19<br />
        2)	In case the bill on actual reading (when taken) is lower than the assessed billed amount, DPC will be recomputed based on the actual bill. Any excess paid DPC will be refunded to you with holding charge as mentioned in para B.
