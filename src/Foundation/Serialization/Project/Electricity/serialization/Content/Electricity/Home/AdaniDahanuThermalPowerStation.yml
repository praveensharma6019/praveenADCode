        <p>Adani - Dahanu Thermal Power Station (ADTPS), consisting two units of 250 MW, is one of the best power generation plants in the country, which commenced its commercial operations in January 1996. Recognized with innumerable awards, this power plant is known for its distinctive features that set it apart from others in terms of technological innovation, superior performance and continuous sustainability for a longer period. ADTPS is located around 120 km north of Mumbai along Mumbai-Ahmedabad rail line.</p>
        <p>The plants utilise a mix of Indian washed coal and imported coal as fuel. The general blending ratio is 80 : 20. The indigenous fuel is received from SECL (Korba) and also imported from various countries such as Indonesia and South Africa among others.</p>
        <p>Adani - Dahanu Thermal Power Station has implemented integrated management systems (IMS) in its processes and is certified for quality management, environment management, occupational health and safety assessment studies, social accountability management, information security management, energy management and accreditation for ADTPS coal testing laboratory.</p>
