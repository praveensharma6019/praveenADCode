        <p>Voluntary Deposit Scheme (VDS) offers you the benefit of paying a deposit in advance and earning interest on your payment.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">No need to worry about monthly payments. Just pay a deposit and we'll adjust your bill amount every month with it.</p>
        <p class="mt-3">The deposit is guaranteed to earn you an <span class="txt-orange">interest at 7% p.a.</span>, which comes into effect from the date of deposit, once the amount has been adjusted against the monthly bill.</p>
        <br />
        <h5 class="txt-orange my-2">Get Started</h5>
        <p class="mt-3">Fill in the VDS application form and deposit in cash/cheque/demand draft at any one of our <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=87F02F4D80C94C47BBC25B0D7C7A0877&amp;_z=z">8 Customer Care Centers</a>.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">You can also apply for the VDS mode of payment by using the Online option.</p>
        <br />
        <h5 class="txt-orange my-2">The deposit limit</h5>
        <p>Remember deposit should be paid for a <span class="txt-orange">minimum of 6 month's average</span> bill but not <span class="txt-orange">less than Rs. 3000/-</span> and in <span class="txt-orange">multiples of Rs. 500/-</span> thereafter.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">The maximum amount that you can deposit <span class="txt-orange">is Rs. 1,00,000</span> but any payment, higher <span class="txt-orange">than Rs.20,000</span>, will not be accepted if made in cash. Moreover, for a deposit <span class="txt-orange">above Rs.20,000</span> you will need to give your PAN number.</p>
        <br />
        <h5 class="txt-orange my-2">Where to deposit</h5>
        <p class="mt-3">Just send in the VDS application along with the deposit (cheque or demand draft) to the following address by mail:</p>
        <p class="mt-3"><strong>VDS Payment</strong></p>

        <br />
        <h5 class="txt-orange my-2">What if the Balance falls short</h5>
        <p>Each month you can view the VDS balance and update your account accordingly.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">If the balance is not enough to pay the current bill, a statement will appear in your monthly bill, informing you in advance.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">You can also receive <span class="txt-orange">alerts via SMS and e-mail</span>.</p>
