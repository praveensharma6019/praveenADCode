        <div class="panel-body">We require access to the meter cabin periodically for reading, checking installation, repairs and maintenance, etc. For this purpose, meters are installed at a location which is easily accessible, without disturbing the consumer. Also, in case the premises are locked, it hampers the meter reading process.</div>
