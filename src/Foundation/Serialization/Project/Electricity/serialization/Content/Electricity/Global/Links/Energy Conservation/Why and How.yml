        					<p class="py-2">The environment is in a state of depletion. Resources are running out and global warming is fast becoming a problem we cannot afford to ignore. Here’s why:</p>
        					<ul class="list-bullet-style">
        					<li>India’s fossil fuel reserves are limited and its economy is highly sensitive to the oil price variations in International market.</li>
        					<li>If the current rate of consumption continues, the known reserves of oil, natural gas and coal may last only for a few more years.</li>
        					<li>The shortage of power is acute in India. Today, the gap between demand and supply is more than 13%.</li>
        					<li>Exploration of new fossil reserves and setting up new power plants attract huge capital investments.</li>
        					<li>The environment suffers with more greenhouse gases being emitted during power generation process.</li>
        					<li>Saving energy will usher in two huge benefits for you: 
        					<ul class="list-bullet-style py-3"> <li>You will save money.</li> <li>You will leave a positive impact on the environment.</li> </ul>
        					</li>
        					</ul>
        					<p>The responsibility to prevent the problem from snowballing rests upon all of us.</p>
