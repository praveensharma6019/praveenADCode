      Value: Dear customer, with reference to your complaint, your meter was inspected at your premise on ONDATEX and checked for any kind of defects. No defects in the connection or the functioning of the meter have been observed. But the Earth Load indicator of your meter was ON. It suggests that there is a leakage in your wiring. We suggest you to check and rectifiy the wiring at your end through an authorised electrical inspector. A correct rectification of the same will be indicated by the OFF position of the Earth Load indicator on your meter. A letter to this effect is forwarded to your registered billing address.
