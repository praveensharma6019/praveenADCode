        After the meter is connected, a <span class="colorBlue">Customer Account Number</span> is allotted based on the location and a nearby Customer Care center. This determines your Cycle Number and Book Number.<br />
        Based on Cycle Number, readings are taken by our <span class="colorBlue">Meter Reader</span> every month, The readings are entered into out billing system that calculates the bill amount. Bills are then printed and dispatched to your billing address.
