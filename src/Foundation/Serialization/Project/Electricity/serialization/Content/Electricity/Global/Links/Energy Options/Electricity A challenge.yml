        				<h3>Electricity - A challenge</h3> <p>Energy is one of the most fundamental parts of our universe. Energy causes things to happen around us. By definition, Energy is the “ability to do work”. It can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another. Energy can be found in a number of different forms such as chemical, thermal, mechanical, radiant, nuclear and electricity. Everything we do is connected to energy in one form or another.</p> <p>Electricity has become an essential part of our lives. It lights up our homes, cooks our food, powers our computers, television sets, and other electronic devices.</p> <p>The global demand for electricity is on an increasing trend and is expected to increase even more in near future. This increasing demand of electricity is putting tremendous pressure on supply side which is dominated by coal. Currently, much of our electricity comes from burning coal in power plants, releasing large quantities of greenhouse gases contributing to global climate change. With increasing demand and no way to store electricity, the challenge is to produce and supply enough electricity to meet this demand.</p>
