        <ul>
        	<li><span style="color:#0566c1">Change in Tariff</span> - Tariff rates are generally revised annually.</li>
        	<li><span style="color:#0566c1">Seasonal Variations</span> - An unusual cold or warm weather can significantly alter your electricity use.</li>
        	<li><span style="color:#0566c1">New electric appliances usage</span> - If you have recently installed a new major electric appliance - such as air conditioner, refrigerator, washing machine or computer - your usage of electricity may increase.</li>
        	<li><span style="color:#0566c1">Defective Electrical appliances</span> - Defective appliances such as air conditioner, refrigerator, washing machine and geyser needs to be repaired immediately as they consume more energy than normal.</li>
        	<li><span style="color:#0566c1">More people in the house</span> - More people in the house leads to more energy consumption and so a higher bill amount.</li>
        	<li><span style="color:#0566c1">Changes in Life style</span> - The life style is influenced by different work shifts, a new baby, and kids out of school for the summer, illness, retirement etc. These in turn affect various factors such as the amount of time spent at home, the number of times the door is opened/closed, the setting on the thermostat, time-spent watching TV, lights used, and number of showers etc. All these results into higher amount of electricity consumption.</li>
        </ul>
