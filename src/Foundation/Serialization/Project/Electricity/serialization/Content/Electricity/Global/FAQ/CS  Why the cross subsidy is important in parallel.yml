      Hint: Answer
      Value: The consumers are allowed to switchover in the parallel license regime. In case the high end consumer desires to switch over to another licensee in the same area, then it would disturb the cross subsidy quantum; which may put burden on the cross subsidized class. As a result, their tariff may unwarrantedly go up.
