      Hint: Answer
      Value: <p>Before making change over application, latest generated bill of EDL needs to be paid, and a copy of the same needs to be submitted along with the application to the NDL. Additionally, on the day of changeover your meter reading will be taken jointly by EDL &amp; NDL. You can remain present if you desire so. This meter reading shall be the final meter reading of the EDL and opening meter reading of the NDL, irrespective of the choice of the meter. A final bill will be raise by EDL based on this final meter reading. This payment has to be made to EDL.</p>
