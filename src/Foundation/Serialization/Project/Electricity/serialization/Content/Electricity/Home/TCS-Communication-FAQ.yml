        Q4. What is the rate at which TCS is levied?
        </div>
        <div id="ans5" class="ans collapse" data-parent="#formsList">
        <p>Ans. TCS is levied at the rate of 0.1% (0.075% for FY 2020-21) and is charged to consumers to whom sales after 30th September 2020 exceeds INR 50 lakhs for FY 20-21, on the incremental amount of over Rs.50 lakhs. For example, if a consumers bill is Rs. 58 lakhs between 1st October,2020 and 31st March,2021, he will be charged 0.075% of Rs. 8 lakhs which is Rs.600/- as TCS. In case the consumer does not provide PAN/provides invalid PAN, then a TCS of 1% is applicable on Rs.8 lakhs which is Rs.8000 will be charged as TCS for the year.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="ans8" class="ans collapse" data-parent="#formsList">

        <div id="ans10" class="ans collapse" data-parent="#formsList">
        <p>Ans. All the registered consumers whose payable amounts exceeds Rs.50 lakh in an FY will automatically fall under the TCS collection net and TCS amount will be debited in the bill. Also, a higher rate of 1% is applicable if PAN is not registered with AEML or is invalid. So, to avoid penalties, registered customer should register the PAN numbers for all the accounts owned by him/her with AEML.</p>
