        <p>Ans: NACH stands for National Automated Clearing House and is a similar facility/platform as ECS only with a faster settlement time of just one day. The various facilities offered by NACH include standardization and digitization of mandates, overall simplification, reduction of operational cost, and minimization of activation time. Existing ECS mandates will now be moved to the NACH platform, in partnership with the participating banks.</p>
