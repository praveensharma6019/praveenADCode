        <p><strong>Ahmedabad, 04 October 2021: </strong>The fifth edition of the Adani Ahmedabad Marathon (AAM) will take place on 27 and 28 November 2021, with options to select between on-ground and app-based remote running. The on-ground event has been planned in the wave format with all Covid precautions in place. The theme for the event remains #Run4OurSoldiers, which is an endeavour to honour the bravehearts of India. Like in the past, this year too, part of the registration proceeds will be donated to the Indian Armed Forces. </p>
        <br />
        <p>&ldquo;Contributing to the welfare of the Indian Armed Forces has been a constant inspiration for us at the Adani Group to organize the Adani Ahmedabad Marathon and make it an annual event,&ldquo; said<strong> Mr. Pranav Adani, MD - Agro and Oil &amp; Gas.</strong> &ldquo;The COVID-19 crisis has reinforced the need to build a mentally and physically fit nation. Community running encourages people to adopt a healthy lifestyle which is sustainable and fosters a spirit of togetherness. We are very excited to invite all the runners, who were waiting for the on-ground event at Adani Shantigram after last year&rsquo;s virtual marathon. And for those who cannot join us in person, we will still look forward to your virtual participation.&rdquo; </p>
        <br />
        <p>Registrations for the 5th AAM, which began on 15 September 2021, will remain open until 15 October 2021. Those who wish to participate can get detailed information on the website, <a href="https://www.ahmedabadmarathon.com/" target="_blank" style="color:Blue;">www.ahmedabadmarathon.com,</a> and from social media platforms. Like in earlier editions, the race will be held in the following categories: full marathon, half marathon, 10 km and 5 km fun run. The on-ground race will be conducted in two slots (morning and evening) over two days. Each slot will have participants running in waves with a gap of 15 minutes. Each wave will see no more than 250 participants to ensure their safety.</p>
        <br />
        <p>While winners will be awarded medals and certified recognition, all participants completing the races will receive a certificate of completion. The prize money will not be applicable for participants who have opted for app-based remote running. Registration for participants in the armed forces will continue to be free. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Kargil War veteran and India&rsquo;s first blade runner, Major D P Singh is the race ambassador of the AAM 2021 edition.
        <br />
        &ldquo;The pandemic has raised much-needed awareness about the importance of health and fitness levels,&rdquo; said <strong>Major D P Singh.</strong> &ldquo;The best way to go in that direction is to just put on your shoes and step out. I have experienced marathon running to aid both physical as well as mental endurance and I am proud to associate with a cause that resonates with me. Join me on the running track of the Adani Ahmedabad Marathon and let&rsquo;s run together for our soldiers! Jai Hind.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Sanitized and touch-free hydration stations will be placed along the route to reduce human contact and participants will be diverted to the parking area from the finish line with food packet, water, energy drink and medal kits. Those who require physiotherapy or medical attention will be diverted to a designated area. </p>
