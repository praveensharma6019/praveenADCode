        <p class="mb-3">Ever wondered what is that one quality that stayed constant since the beginning of human civilization?  </p>
        <p class="mb-3">The quest to survive and strive for better.  </p>
        <p class="mb-3">More than 3000 years passed between Javelin legend, Jan Železný’s world record setting 98.48 meter throw and the ancient games training humans to hunt. What did not change over the enormous periods of history is a sportsperson’s adrenalin rush to go the extra mile and make a mark. </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Adani Sportsline is a humble step to celebrate this burning spirit unique about sports and the large community that is born to play. It is an extension of our growth philosophy to building India in every possible way. Nation-building for us is not confined to the critical infrastructure built over the past three decades by the Adani Group. We believe that building a nation is also about building upon the youth’s aspiration. It is also about building confidence, pride and inspiration in its people. It is also about contributing to the sentiments of 1.37 billion people when they watch the Indian tricolour fly on the global stage.   </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Our vision is to create an ecosystem that caters to all these needs. Given the strong government impetus to Indian sports through visionary initiatives such as Khelo India, this is our time to up the game. Adani Sportsline is strategically modelled to deeply leverage the rising positive sentiment among India’s sporting talent. From inculcating a culture of sports at the grassroots level, to identifying and incubating sporting talent from underprivileged backgrounds, our foremost goal is to create a boundless appetite to dream. Next in line comes our strategic investments in franchise leagues that are popularizing home-grown sports like Kabbadi, Kho-Kho, and Boxing etc. building robust career options for sportspersons and a network of professionals with potential to transform the sector into a value-compounding industry.  </p>
        <p class="mb-3">For long, the want for world-class training infrastructure has denied equal opportunities to our sportspersons. Now is the time to eliminate these gaps and build a level playing field for them. The third and final piece of our self-sustained ecosystem is a state-of-the-art sports training academy offering performance-intensive training regime to athletes.  </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Given the rich talent in our country, we want to see India emerge as a powerhouse of sports. In closing, I reminisce one of my favourite quotes by Swami Vivekananda.</p>
        <p class="mb-3"><b>"India must conquer the world, and nothing less than that is my ideal. It may be very big, it may astonish many of you, but it is so."</b></p>
        <p class="mb-3">Jai Hind! </p>
