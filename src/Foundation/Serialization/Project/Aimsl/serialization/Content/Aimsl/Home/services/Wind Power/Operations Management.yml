        <p>AIMSL is working on its Adani &ndash; Energy Network Operation Centre (Adani-ENOC), a state-of-the-art facility to monitor all the wind turbines 24*7 from the headquarters. This will bring greater transparency and supervision. In future, it will also generate smart reports, SAP notification for preventive maintenance, breakdown maintenance and executive details, which will facilitate in taking important decisions. With this advance technology, AIMSL will have greater control of its windfarms and increased performance of the turbines. This <span>Adani-ENOC&nbsp;</span>facility is also going to be one of its kind in India where an O&amp;M service provider is simultaneously monitoring and analyzing wind and solar energy on a single platform. </p>
