        </div>
        <p class="mb-3">It is our earnest endeavor to evolve a socially responsible and sustainable business scenario, which fetches long-term returns to our stakeholders. Our capabilities in the transmission sector were demonstrated in July 2017 when we took over the Operation & Maintenance of transmission network spanning more than 11,000+ ckt. kms. and 15,000+ MVA of power transformation. Likewise, just over a year later, we established our presence in the renewables sector managing a portfolio of 2.2 GW spanning across 44 sites. Given that our footprints make us one of the leading O&M service providers in the Transmission and Renewable segment, we take immense pride in contributing to India’s core infrastructure sector, in line with the Adani Group’s overarching philosophy of nation building.   </p>
        <p class="mb-3">We practice passionate leadership with our dedication, result orientation, integration and entrepreneurial mind-set. These characteristics draw strength from our core values of Courage, Trust and Commitment. Our vision is to be known for the scale of our ambitions, technological leadership and customer delight. We will take calculated risks at any opportune time in pursuing new business ventures in this field. </p>
        <p class="mb-3"><b>Overall success can be achieved only if our employees reach home safely every day. </b> </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Safety has always been and would always be a top priority in AIMSL. We believe  that safety is not the responsibility of one person  but shared responsibility across all levels of our company. This allows us to protect our employees, clients and the public. We always ensure that we do not lower our safety standards. This has led to developing a team dedicated for the compliance of Adani Safety Rules and Regulations. Our aim is to set new safety benchmarks at par with global standards. </p>
        <p class="mb-3"><b>Innovation is at the heart of our business model. </b> </p>
        <p class="mb-3">We will strive to meet the current and future needs of our customers by improving service experience, providing leading/ cutting-edge technology solutions to enable the success of our customers. All such activities drive our commitment to innovation, allowing us to achieve an outstandingly competitive position in the industry.</p>
        <p class="mb-3"><b>We strongly believe that employees are center to our aspirations. </b> </p>
        <p class="mb-3">We will endeavor to build an organization with passionate employees. Our employees commit themselves with passion to quality, innovation, courage, attention to detail and with a “make it happen” mindset. As an organization, it is essential to embody these values. Given the buoyant outlook for the renewable and transmission businesses, we have a robust team of more than 450 members dedicated to drive growth and deliver utmost client satisfaction. </p>
        <p class="mb-3"><b>We aim to put clients first in all that we do. </b> </p>
        <p class="mb-3">As an organization, our paramount focus is to build long-term unwavering relationships with customers, to help them meet their business objectives. We shall stand by our commitment to our customers, excelling in everything we do and creating value for all our stakeholders.</p>
        <p class="mb-3"><b>Our people are the most valuable assets.</b> </p>
        <p class="mb-3">AIMSL provides direct inputs into employee training & development plan. This includes contributing and driving a learning culture that promotes formal and informal learning interventions. Setting the right foundation for the organization's talent pipeline has been our goal.</p>
