        <ul class="ul-bullets">
        								<li>The next era of transmission asset maintenance has dawned with UAV based inspection.</li>
        								<li>Persistent faults have been overcome with vigilant inspection. Prevailing conditions of a transmission system assure clients of benefits in cost, safety, reliability & response time.</li>
        	<li>  UAV facilitates UAV inspection of transmission system defects which are usually un-observed during routine patrolling or to the naked eyes. It helps improve the efficiency of inspection & creates a scientific and accurate approach towards deriving standardised inspection results.</li>
        							</ul>
