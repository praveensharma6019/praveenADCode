      Value: "As a pilot project, AEML in-house team has developed 1000 kVA trolly mounted mobile Sub-Station which can be placed from hours to two- or three-months. The advantage of this trolly sub-station is, it requires minimum time as compared to conventional sub-station, hence it is used for catering emergency power supply in case of sub-station equipment failures or releasing temporary load to commercial and residential consumers. Can be installed at any site, substation premises, exhibition and other locations."
