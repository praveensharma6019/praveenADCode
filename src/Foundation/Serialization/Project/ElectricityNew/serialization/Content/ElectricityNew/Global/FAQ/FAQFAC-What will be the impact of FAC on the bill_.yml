        <p>As per MERC MYT Order issued in March 2020 for the period FY 20-21 to FY 24-25, each utility is required to create an FAC Fund wherein negative variation (lower power purchase vis-à-vis approved power purchase) is deposited in the Fund instead of being refunded back to the consumer. This negative variation ensured that no FAC levy was necessary, however the following factors impacted this negative variation fund:
        •	Russia-Ukraine war, which impacted coal and natural gas supplies across the world
        •	Extreme Heat Wave conditions, with India witnessing record breaking temperatures leading to steep rise in electricity demand.
        The above factors led to sharp rise in spot prices of power and the gains due to negative variation in FAC fund were also set off against this rise, leading to requirement of FAC levy.</p>
