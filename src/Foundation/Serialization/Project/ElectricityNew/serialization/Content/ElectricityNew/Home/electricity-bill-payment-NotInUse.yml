        <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">Bill payments have become a necessity in modern times. From a middle-class person to a billionaire, everyone has to pay bills for the utilities they and their families consume. However, in a developing country such as India, not everyone has access to modern technologies which make bill payments much easier. There's a huge gap between the access to this technology for persons who have bills to pay. Since a large chunk of the country&rsquo;s population lives in the rural areas, it is difficult to acquaint everyone with the latest technologies to help pay bills faster.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">If we look at the bills that one has to pay daily, these include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DTH/Cable TV Bills</li>

        <h5 style="padding:0px 0px 5px 0px;">What is an electricity bill payment?</h5>
        </header>
        <p>With modern technologies coming into play, electricity is not a luxury anymore but a basic amenity. There was a time when very few people in India had access to basic amenities including clean water, food, and electricity. However, with changing times, more people are getting access to modern technologies including electricity and the internet.</p>
        <p>Every <strong>energy bill</strong> seems important. Nowadays, our lives are also hugely dependent on electric appliances. Right from the fan to the washing machine, everything runs on electricity. That also means that paying your electricity bill is important since it ensures the continuous supply of electricity at your homes, offices, schools and colleges.</p>
        <p>An electricity bill can be generated by calculating the number of units that have been used at your home or office. For this purpose, an electronic meter is fitted into these spaces for easy access. The bill generated at the end of each month is to be paid by the user.</p>
        <header class="section-header" style="margin-bottom:0px;">
        <h5 style="padding:0px 0px 5px 0px;">How is the Electricity Bill Calculated?</h5>
        </header>
        <p>If you want to have an accurate estimate of the amount of energy that your electrical appliances consume daily, you may need to do a little maths for the same.</p>
        <p>To know the amount used to <strong>pay your electricity bill,</strong> you must know the wattage of the electrical appliance, the time (in hours) you use it every day, and the estimated price per kilowatt (kW) of electricity used in an hour. The last two units can be easily found on your bill and the daily use can be figured out easily too.</p>
        <p>To understand the wattage of an appliance, look at the manual or documents that came with it. You'll find the wattage listed with a 'W' for the same. After finding that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Multiply the wattage of your appliance with the number of hours it is used in a day.</li>
            <li>Now, divide the total by 1,000.</li>
            <li>Multiply the result by your kWh rate set by your electricity board.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this way, you can determine how much electricity your appliance is consuming and it determines your bill payment as well. The maths is a bit tiresome but it'll give you a rough estimate of your expenses nonetheless.</p>

        <h5 style="padding:0px 0px 5px 0px;">What is the Importance of Timely Bill Payments?</h5>
        </header>
        You might have understood by now that paying your electricity bills on time serves a greater purpose in the long run. Sooner or later, you have to pay your bills. So why not do it on time and avoid inconvenience later?
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The various demerits of late bill payments are:</p>
        <h5 style="font-family: 'Roboto-Bold'; font-size:16px; margin-bottom:6px">Late Fees/Fine</h5>
        <p>It is quite common in a place like India to see additional charges or a penalty being imposed on your overall electricity bill if you don't pay it on time. To pay bills on time, one should always remember the deadlines and set alerts for the same. Who would like to be charged extra for the electricity that they didn't use in the first place? Some electricity boards may also apply an interest rate for defaulters who don't pay the bills for a long time.</p><br />
        <h5 style="font-family: 'Roboto-Bold'; font-size:16px; margin-bottom:6px">Stoppage of Connection</h5>
        <p>If your electricity bills are way past the deadline, then it is quite possible that your electricity board may even consider cutting your electricity supply. We get irritated at a minor power cut. Imagine how it would feel to live without electricity altogether?</p>
        <p>If you're an office owner or have a factory of your own, this can cause a loss of production, time, and even labour. It is difficult to establish your electricity connection unless the dues are cleared.</p><br />
        <h5 style="font-family: 'Roboto-Bold'; font-size:16px; margin-bottom:6px">Unnecessary Calls</h5>
        <p>If your electricity bill is not paid on time, you'll receive several text messages, emails, and even calls urging you to <strong>pay your bills</strong> on time. This can get on your nerves and cause distress. It would also waste a lot of time for your office employees who are tasked with attending calls and messages.</p><br />
        <h5 style="font-family: 'Roboto-Bold'; font-size:16px; margin-bottom:6px">Anxiety and Distress</h5>
        <p>The constant headache about unpaid electricity bills in the back of your mind will not give you any joy and can make you feel irritated quickly. It will also aggravate your anxiety and increase your stress levels. This is harmful for both your physical and mental health. It is likely to destabilize the environment of your house as well as the office.</p>
        <p>To avoid all these, you should pay your bill on time. You can do that online as well as offline. Timely payments are extremely important for your peace of mind. If you often forget about your bill payment, set up alerts on your mobile phone or make post-it notes that will remind you of the same.</p>
        <p>One should know <strong>how to pay late electricity bills online</strong> as well as offline.</p>
