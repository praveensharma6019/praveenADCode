        <p>Once an online payment is made via the app, an acknowledgment of the same is displayed. Details of the payment made will be seen under the "Mobile App Payment Log" in the app. Once the payment has been successfully accounted for, against your Adani Electricity account, the payment will be visible under the "Payment History" section. Subsequently, you will also be able to download a payment receipt for the same.</p>
