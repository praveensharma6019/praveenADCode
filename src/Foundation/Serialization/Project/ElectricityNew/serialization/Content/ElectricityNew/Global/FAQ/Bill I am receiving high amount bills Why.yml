        <div class="cms-content">
        <p><strong>Change in Tariff</strong> - Tariff rates are generally revised annually.</p>
        	<p><strong>Seasonal Variations</strong> - An unusual cold or warm weather can significantly alter your electricity use.</p>
        	<p><strong>New electric appliances usage</strong> - If you have recently installed a new major electric appliance - such as air conditioner, refrigerator, washing machine or computer - your usage of electricity may increase.</p>
        	<p><strong>Defective Electrical appliances</strong> - Defective appliances such as air conditioner, refrigerator, washing machine and geyser need to be repaired immediately as they consume more energy than normal.</p>
        	<p><strong>More people in the house</strong> - More people in the house leads to more energy consumption and so a higher bill amount.</p>
        	<p><strong>Changes in Lifestyle</strong> - The lifestyle is influenced by different work shifts, a new baby, illness, retirement, etc. These in turn affect various factors such as the amount of time spent at home, the number of times the door is opened/closed, the setting on the thermostat, time spent in watching TV, lights used, and number of showers, etc. All these result into higher amount of electricity consumption.</p>
