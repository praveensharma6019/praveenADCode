        <p>The installation Test Report is Issued&nbsp;by the licensed Electrical Contractor (LEC) which certifies that the electrical installation work at the applicants
        premises has been carried out by the Licensed Electrical Contractors in full conformity with the Indian Electricity Rules,1956 and the conditions of Supply.
        For EODB customers, the physical requirement of 'Test Report' is now eliminated and replaced by an online self declaration, during submission of online
        application as per MERC Practice Direction dated 25-Mar-2019.<br />
        Other customers are required to enter the Test report number in the online application form.
