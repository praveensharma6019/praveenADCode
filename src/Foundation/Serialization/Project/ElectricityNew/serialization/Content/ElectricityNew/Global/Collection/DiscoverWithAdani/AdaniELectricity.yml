                At Adani Electricity we firmly believe in the "Power of Service" - Not just meant 
                to power a home or a business, but to power everyone’s life. We understand how 
                important power supply is to every citizen and therefore AEML 
                strives to provide reliable electricity supply at competitive and cost-effective prices.
                <br /><br />
                The AEML (Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited) website is 
                not only a medium to inform people about who we are, 
                but also an opportunity to engage with all our stakeholders, both existing and upcoming. 
                <br /><br />
                We believe in rewarding the efforts of our Adani consumer family. 
                Therefore, Adani Electricity also has a reward programme called 
                Electric Smiles. Our consumers can access the reward point programme, 
                Electric Smiles, through the Adani Electricity mobile app. The 
                consumer’s electricity account gets directly credited with the points 
                that they earn on any cashless payments made for Adani Electricity bills. 
                There is also a provision to earn additional bonus points on all 
                AEML electricity bill payments that you make within 7 days of the electricity bill generation.

                Residential and Group Housing categories as per MNRE guidelines 
                for the Program. Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited acts as the nodal 
                implementing agency for the MNRE Program and a channel for extending the
