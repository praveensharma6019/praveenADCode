      Hint: Answer
      Value: |
        <p>You have the option to indicate the upper limit for your mandate. If in any month your electricity bill amount exceeds the mandate amount the bill amount will not be debited to your bank account. In such cases a message" Bill exceeds Mandate" will be printed on your bill and you will have to pay the bill in the normal manner at our collection centre /other payment modes.</p>
