        <div class="cms-content"><ul>
            <li>Due to Covid-19 pandemic meter reading was discontinued and has been gradually resumed from June 2020 onwards.</li>
            <li>As per MERC practice directions (click <a href="/">here</a> to know more) we have billed you for the March & April billing cycles based upon your previous three months’ average consumption, which pertains to the winter months of December to February.</li>
            <li>Upon obtaining the actual reading in June, the billing for the period has been amended and actual units have been uniformly allocated for the entire three-month period. </li>
            <li>The estimated bills are then deducted from the actual billing for the period and the difference amount between actual and estimated bills is included.</li>
            <li>Any payment made by you during the period is also adjusted while revising the billing for the period as per your actual reading.</li>
            <li>Your May 2020 bill raised in June, therefore, includes the consumption of May 2020 as well as differential consumption over the estimation of March 2020 and April 2020.</li>
        </ul>
