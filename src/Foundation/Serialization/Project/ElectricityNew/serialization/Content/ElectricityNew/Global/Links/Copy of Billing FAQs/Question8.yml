        <p>Due to Covid-19 precautionary directives given by MERC, our Customer Care Centres /Bill Payment Centres/Meter Reading/Bill Distribution / Meter testing etc which require human interface had to be closed & only critical services like power supply restoration were in operation for your convenience. Due to this pandemic situation, reading for this lockdown period could not be taken and bills were charged on an estimation basis as per directives. However, we had taken utmost effort to take the readings wherever possible.</p></div>
