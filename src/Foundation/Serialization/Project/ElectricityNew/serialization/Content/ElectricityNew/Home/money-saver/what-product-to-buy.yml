        <h2>Buy ‘Energy Efficient’ Products</h2>
        <p><strong>What are energy-efficient appliances?</strong></p>
        <p>‘Energy efficiency’ is a frequently used term in our climate-conscious world. Appliances that help save energy by reducing the consumption levels are called energy efficient appliances. Using <strong>energy efficient electrical appliances</strong> will help protect the environment and bring down the carbon footprint too. The more energy-efficient an electrical appliance is, the less it costs to use.</p>
        <p>Owning such devices can help you save money on electricity, lead an eco-friendly lifestyle and improve the quality of your life. Households are one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions as they use electrical appliances that consume a lot of energy. The daily energy consumption of each household is fairly more than the everyday energy consumed by your car.</p>
        <p><strong>With a number of products in the market claiming to be energy efficient, how do you decide which energy-efficient products should you buy?</strong></p>
        <p>Simple. Just look for the BEE Star Rating on every electrical appliance from refrigerators, air conditioners to ceiling fans, colour televisions, etc.</p>
        <p>Every product carries a rating between 1 to 5 stars, products rated 5 stars being the most efficient. The higher the ratings the more you save on your electricity bills. </p>
        <p>The difference between energy consumption of a 1-star and 5-star rated refrigerator of a 200 Litres capacity is approximately 320 units annually which saves you more than ₹1600/- per year. </p>
        <p>For more information on the EE products please refer to the BEE website at <span><a href="https://beeindia.gov.in/" target="_blank">https://beeindia.gov.in/</a></span> Also, you can visit <span><a href="https://beeindia.gov.in/content/standards-labeling" target="_blank">https://beeindia.gov.in/content/standards-labeling</a></span> to find more on "5 Star Labelled Appliances of BEE".</p>
