      Hint: NewsSummary
      Value: "Adani Electricity has waged a war against power theft and pilferage as it is not only a criminal offence but also a social offence. During raids 75.57 tons of illegal wires were recovered. Theft of 14.82 million units and Rs.21.75 crore assessed. Aggregate Commercial and Technical Losses (AT&amp;C) were brought down from 7.82% in FY 2020-21 to 6.55% in FY 2021-22. Power theft puts tariff burden on honest and paying consumers which is unacceptable to AEML as a distribution utility."
