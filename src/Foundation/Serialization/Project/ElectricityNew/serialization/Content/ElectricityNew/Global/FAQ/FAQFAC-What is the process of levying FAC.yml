      Hint: Answer
      Value: <p>FAC can be levied up to 20% of tariff charges. Any unrecovered FAC above the same is carried forward for future periods. Further, MERC issued a letter in April 2022, stating that the FAC to be levied for a particular month will not be levied in one single month. The letter further stated that FAC accumulation will be done for a period of 3 months and levy will be allowed to be recovered by spreading over the next 3 months, thus permitting a smoothened recovery. </p>
