        				<h3>Overcoming the challenge</h3> <p>The solution lies in constructing a plan to meet our current as well as future electricity needs at a reliable, cost-competitive yet environment friendly way. Here’s how we can do that:</p> <ul> <li><span>Judicious Use:</span> Employ energy conservation tips while using your electrical appliances anytime, anywhere.</li> <li><span>Energy conservation:</span> It is estimated that we can save 10-15% energy easily through smart conservation. In the long run, this can result in huge savings.</li> <li><span>Green Energy Sources:</span> Increasing the share of Non-conventional energy sources such as wind power, solar power, hydro power etc. are environment friendly power sources.</li> <li><span>Efficient Transmission &amp; Distribution systems:</span> Electricity generated in plants is transmitted to areas where it is consumed through the Transmission and Distribution network. During this movement of electricity, some energy is lost due to resistance in wires and equipments. Adopting better technology, better system design, adequate investment in system, installing electronic meters, actions to curb power thefts etc will make the Transmission &amp; Distribution system more efficient thereby reducing the losses in transit.</li> <li><span>Smart Grid:</span> Smart Grid technologies can transform an electric power delivery system into an intelligent, durable, dependable, self-balancing, and interactive network.
