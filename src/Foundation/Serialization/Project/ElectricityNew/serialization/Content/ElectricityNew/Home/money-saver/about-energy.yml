        <p>Read more about what is energy and why should it be conserved</p>
        <p>Energy forms the most fundamental part of our daily lives. From minutest to the most macrodynamic levels, it is energy that causes things to happen in the universe.</p>
        <p>The electricity that we use for our everyday tasks is one of the most widely used forms of energy. This electricity is a secondary energy source since it is created by converting primary sources of energy such as green energy which is solar &amp; wind energy, coal, natural gas, etc. Electricity has become an essential part of our lives. It lights up our homes, cooks our food, powers our sources of entertainment, and helps energise all other electronic devices that are part of our necessities nowadays.</p>
        <p>The global demand for electricity is on an increasing trend and is expected to increase even more in near future. This increasing demand of electricity is putting tremendous pressure on supply side which is dominated by coal. Currently, much of our electricity supply comes from burning coal in power plants, releasing large quantities of greenhouse gases contributing to global climate change. With increasing demand and no way to store electricity, the challenge is to produce and supply enough electricity to meet this demand.</p><br />
        <h5>How do we deal with the energy supply challenge?</h5>
        <p>The solution lies in constructing a plan to meet our current as well as future electricity needs at a reliable, cost-competitive yet environment friendly way. Here&rsquo;s how we can do that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy Conservation - Apply prudence while using your electrical appliances. You can save up to 15% energy easily through smart use and make huge savings. </li>
            <li>Use Green Energy: Increase the use of non-conventional energy sources such as wind power, solar power, hydro power, etc. as they are environment friendly power sources.</li>
            <li>Efficient Transmission &amp; Distribution systems: Electricity generated in plants is transmitted to areas where it is consumed through the transmission and distribution network. During this movement of electricity, some energy is lost due to resistance in wires and equipment. Adopting better technology, system design, adequate investment in system, installing electronic meters, taking action to curb power thefts, etc. will make the Transmission &amp; Distribution system more efficient thereby reducing the losses in transit. </li>
            <li>Smart Grid: Smart Grid technologies can transform an electric power delivery system into an intelligent, durable, dependable, self-balancing, and interactive network. </li>
        </ul>
