        <div class="cms-content"><p>If Readings are estimated in the earlier month and if actual reading is obtained in the current month, a consolidated amendment bill is raised. Based on the current actual reading, earlier units are prorated, and readings get revised to adjust slab benefit. This essentially means that the total actual consumption is spread across the estimation period for uniform distribution, so that all the consumption is not recorded in one bill, hitting the highest consumption slab and overall higher cost to the user.</p></div>
