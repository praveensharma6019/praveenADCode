        <p>Every product carries a rating between 1 to 5 stars. Products rated 5 stars being the most efficient. The higher the ratings the more you save on your electricity bills.</p>
        <p>The difference between energy consumption of a 1-star and 5-star rated refrigerator of a 200 Litres capacity is approximately 320 units annually which saves you more than Rs.1600 per year. </p>
