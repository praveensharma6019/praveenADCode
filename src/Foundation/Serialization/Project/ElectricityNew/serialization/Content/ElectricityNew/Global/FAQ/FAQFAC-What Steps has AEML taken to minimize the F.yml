      Hint: Answer
      Value: <p>AEML had proper coal linkages and was using domestic coal and not relying on imported coal. So, the increase in prices in the imported coal had no bearing on the power cost for AEML. Also, AEML had resorted to banking of power, which helped in curtailing the increased power purchase cost in the market. Adani Electricity has tied up for 700 MW hybrid renewable energy, this power will start flowing from August 2022.</p>
