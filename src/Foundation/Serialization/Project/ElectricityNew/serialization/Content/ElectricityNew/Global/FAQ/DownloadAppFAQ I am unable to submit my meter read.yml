      Hint: Answer
      Value: <p>In case, an AEML employee has already noted your meter reading, a message will be displayed stating that the same has been done. The next date on which the meter reading needs to be submitted, will be displayed. This check has been put in place, to avoid duplication of meter reading submission, which might result in billing issues.</p>
