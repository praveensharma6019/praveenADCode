      Hint: Answer
      Value: Adani Electricity bills are based on meter readings which reflect actual consumption of power. There may be differences in two bills due to Change in Tariff, seasonal variations, New electric appliances usage, More people in the house, Changes in Life style etc. In case of billing errors, corrections are made in the bills and communicated to the customer.
