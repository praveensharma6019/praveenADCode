            <div class="cms-content">
            <p>Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India, on 19th February 2019, approved Phase-II of 'Grid Connected Rooftop and Small Solar Power Plants Program' for achieving cumulative capacity of 40 GW
            RTS Plants by 2022. In Phase-II, it has been decided to implement the Program by making the DISCOMs and its local offices as the nodal points for implementation of the program. DISCOMs will play a key role in expansion
            of Rooftop Solar as DISCOMs are having a direct contact with end user and they provide approval for installation, manage the distribution network, and also have billing interface with rooftop owner. </p>
            <p>The Program is primarily for promotion of Grid-connected Rooftop Solar (RTS) PV Projects in Residential and Group Housing categories by way of providing Central Financial Assistance (CFA) for the household owner and
            Group Housing Societies to set up RTS on the rooftop of their residence/residential campus.</p>

                <li>At the time of applying for Grid Connectivity, the consumer will have to notify AEML Office whether he wants to participate in the Program. The consumer will also have to specify the name of the vendor whose services
                he wants to avail at the time of application.</li>
                <li>Consumer will have to avail the service of any of the empaneled vendors as per the Vendor list given for installation, testing &amp; commissioning of RTS system. For any enquiry related to installation, Consumer

                <li>However, MNRE is in the process of further simplification of RTS program under which the residential consumers will have flexibility to get Rooftop Solar Plant installed by themselves of vendor of their choice.
                Accordingly, MNRE is in the process of setting up National Portal and upon setting up of same, consumers will have choice of installing Rooftop Solar Plant availing either of the option.</li>
                <li>Till the time MNRE sets up National Portal, if the consumer avails the services of any other vendor except those empaneled for installation, testing &amp; commissioning of RTS system, s/he will NOT BE eligible for

        <h5>India's Solar Rooftop</h5>
        <p>Numerous people in India have adopted reliable renewable power sources like rooftop solar for homes and workspaces. The photovoltaic cells and solar power units atop commercial and residential buildings have become a common sight in
        many cities and towns across the nation.
        </p>
        <p>India is among the nations with the highest sustainable or renewable power generation rates. As of 2019, renewable energy sources accounted for 35 percent of the nation&rsquo;s installed power generation capacity, generating 17 percent
        of the nation&rsquo;s total electricity.</p>
        <p>The adoption of rooftop solar panels usage is clearly on the rise. The rooftop solar panel sub-sector has grown faster than every other renewable energy sub-sector, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 116 percent between 2012
        and 2018. Further, The World Bank has pledged US$625 million in financial support for grid-connected rooftop solar projects to help India meet its ambitious objective of attaining 227 GW (it was previously 175 GW) of power generation.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, the rate of adoption of solar power is not limited to commercial or industrial buildings. With the fast advances in technology and the growing distribution network, solar-powered houses are fast becoming the most
        natural choice for homeowners in every city and town.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-cell">
        <h5>How much of the rooftop should be used for generating electricity?</h5>
        <p>The maximum power generation capacity is calculated based on the intensity and hours of sunshine available as well as the space available on the rooftop. Depending on the type of solar power system &ndash; on-grid, off-grid, or hybrid
        &ndash; a homeowner can choose the total electricity generation capacity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-cell">
        <h5>Advantages of Solar Power</h5>
        <p>Apart from being a sustainable, renewable, clean energy source, solar power comes with a number of other advantages, both for industrial and non-industrial consumers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-cell">
        <ul>
            <li>Low running cost</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The reduction in cost is the most significant advantage of installing rooftop solar panels. Rooftop solar tariffs are 17% to 27% less expensive than industrial and commercial solar tariffs. This is a great benefit for both industrial
        users as well as individuals. Accounting for total lifespan, low running costs, and low installation costs, rooftop solar energy offers a distinct edge over conventional power generation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-cell">
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rooftop solar power units do not emit carbon dioxide or other poisonous gases. Solar energy is harvested by capturing sunlight through photovoltaic cells, so there aren&rsquo;t any health hazards associated with the system. Solar energy
        is clean, green, and healthy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-cell">
        <ul>
            <li>Low maintenance cost</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rooftop solar power units are highly cost-effective. There are no significant regular expenditures involved. With regular cleaning and maintenance from time to time, solar power units are easy to install and keep running. Rooftop units
        typically have a 25-year life expectancy, and this makes their installation an excellent investment. In fact, Adani&rsquo;s asset management technology monitors the health and maintenance of installed solar panels, so a consumer
        can be at ease at all times.</p>

            <li>Perfect for India</li>
        </ul>
        <p>India is in the most perfect geographical location for solar energy. Most parts of the country obtain plenty of tropical sunlight. With over 300 bright days and clear skies each year, the conditions for harvesting solar energy in the
        country is just about the most ideal in the world.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Easy installation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because the system is installed on the roofs of commercial and residential buildings, it does not require a great amount of land or space. This makes solar energy both viable and sustainable. The added benefit of solar rooftop systems
        is the higher resale value that one can expect from solar cells.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>In a grid-connected rooftop or small solar photovoltaic (SPV) system, the DC electricity generated by solar panels is converted to AC power by a power conditioning unit or an inverter and then transmitted to the grid.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header">Q3. What kinds of roofs are appropriate for a rooftop solar (RTS) system?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>Rooftop solar PV systems can be built on any sort of roof that can support the weight of the solar power units.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header">Q4. What is the daily energy generated by a solar power plant with a capacity of 1 kWp?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>A 1 kWp solar power plant may generate 4 to 5.5 units per day on a clear sunny day.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header">Q5. Will I get the same amount of energy from the RTS all year?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>No, the RTS&rsquo; daily energy generation is reliant on multiple factors, including temperature and solar irradiation, which may not be consistent.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>No. When solar modules are exposed to sunlight and the outside environment for a significant amount of time, they start to lose their generation capacity. This is referred to as deterioration.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header">Q7. What is the rate at which the total cost of the solar rooftop plant is determined?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>Consumers are urged to pay just the rates set by the DISCOMs (L1 rates). If any vendors charge a higher price than the rates set by DISCOMs for domestic users, consumers will be intimated.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header">Q9. What are my options for paying the Electricity Distribution Company (DISCOM)?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>DISCOM will create a charge based on the reading provided by the net meter installed at the consumer&rsquo;s premises because the system is grid-connected through net metering. Only the net units (total imported units minus
            exported solar units) will be charged to the consumer.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header">Q10. What are the different models for putting rooftop PV systems in place?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>CAPEX Model: In this model, the consumer owns the system and is responsible for its costs. The entire system is owned by the third-party project developer in the RESCO model. The consumer only purchases the generated energy
            by paying a monthly fee determined by the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The developer is also responsible for O&amp;M over the system's lifetime (25 years).</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header">Q11. If I live in a rental house, can I still install a rooftop solar system?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>The rooftop solar system can be deployed by the electrical customer under any framework, such as net or gross metering. So, if you have an electrical connection in your name, obtain permission from the owner to use the
            roof for solar rooftop installation.</p>
