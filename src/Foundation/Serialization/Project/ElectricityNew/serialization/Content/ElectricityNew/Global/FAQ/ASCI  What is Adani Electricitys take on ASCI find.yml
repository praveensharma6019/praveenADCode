        <div class="panel-body">Third party independent investigation agency duly appointed by the regulator has vindicated Adani Electricity's stand. It's Adani Electricity's expertise and endeavours in managing the power purchases, which have brought much more relief for Mumbai consumers in the booming prices in open market and profiteering attitude displayed by the other utilities by selling surplus power outside the licensed distribution areas in Mumbai instead of selling power in its own licensed distribution area.</div>
