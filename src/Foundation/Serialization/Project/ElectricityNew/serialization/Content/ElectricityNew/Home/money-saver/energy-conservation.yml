        <h5>What is Energy Conservation?</h5>
        Energy conservation is becoming important in daily life because not only do you save money, but you are also making a positive impact on the environment. The environment is in a constant state of depletion. Resources are running out and global warming is fast becoming a problem we cannot afford to ignore. Here’s why:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>India’s fossil fuel reserves are limited, and its economy is highly sensitive to the oil price variations in the international markets.</li>
        <li>If the current rate of consumption continues, the known reserves of oil, natural gas and coal may last only for a few more years.</li>
        <li>The shortage of power is acute in India. Today, the gap between demand and supply is more than 13%.</li>
        <li>Exploration of new fossil reserves and setting up new power plants attract huge capital investments.</li>
        <li>The environment suffers with more greenhouse gases being emitted during power generation process.</li>
        </ul></p>
