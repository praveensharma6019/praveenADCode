        <p><strong>E-Nach</strong> (Electronic National Automated Clearing House) plays a significant role in this journey towards digitisation and electronic billing. It is an electronic process that helps banks and other government bodies to enable automated payment services.</p>
        <p>We all are on the go 24*7, and every minute seems valuable. Years ago, the concept of electronic billing seemed impossible. However, today, it has revolutionised the international market as things have become much more accessible for everyone worldwide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-cell">
        <h3>About E-Nach</h3>
        <p><strong>E-Nach</strong> refers to an electronic process that enables banks, financial institutions, and other government bodies to auto-debit the said amount from your bank account. Once users activate the NACH mode, they are allowing the bank or the concerned authority to access their account. They can then automate their electricity bills from their accounts on the fixed date of every month.</p>
        <p>In the NACH mode, it’s a common scenario that the amount to be paid is higher than the mandated amount. In such cases, the account holder is responsible for clearing the bill separately via different modes of payment, including banking, mobile-based payment options, net banking and so on. Take note, that this information will be mentioned in a separate section under “important messages” in your electricity bill. The instruction you provide to banks or other government bodies to directly debit the amount from your account is known as “Mandate”.</p>
        <p>Let’s say you have decided to go for the <strong>E-NACH</strong> mandate for electricity bill payment. This means all the following electricity bill payments will be scheduled for an automated payment system through your bank account instead of manually checking and remembering the last date of clearing payments. The process eliminates the chances of forgetting about deadlines or making individual payments with penalties.</p>
