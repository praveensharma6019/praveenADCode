        <p>Charges payable by the utility to the consumer on the difference between excess assessment and actual consumption. This is a credit amount. It is calculated at 1 monthly SBI MCLR rate of 6.95% applied on the difference of actual and assessed bill amounts paid.<br />
        An example is as follows:<br />
        a. Assessed bill for April 20 = ₹2000/-<br />
        b. Date of the bill: 01.05.2020 Due Date: 21.05.2020<br />
        c. Amount paid on 18.05.2020- ₹1800/-<br />
        d. Revised bill for April 20 = ₹1500/-<br />
        e. Bill revision date: 28.05.2020<br />
        f. Difference between the assessed bill and revised bill = 2000-1500=500<br />
        g. Eligible amount for holding cost = c-d, i.e., 1800-1500=300<br />
        h. No. of days = (28.05.2020-18.05.2020) = 10 days<br />
        i. Holding cost = (g) * 6.95%* 10/365 = ₹0.57<br />
        Further, the following practice directions are issued by the Hon&rsquo;ble Commission, on 09/05/2020, in respect of billing to electricity consumers during the lockdown period:<br />
        <strong>A. Fixed Charges Moratorium for Commercial &amp; Industrial Consumers</strong>
        <br />
        For Industrial &amp; Commercial consumers, the recovery of fixed/demand charges applicable for 3 months moratorium period is as follows:<br />
        a) To be recovered in equal interest-free instalments in the subsequent three billing cycles.<br />
        b) If you pay the entire amount of 3 months moratorium period upfront in a single payment, the rebate of 1% shall be given.<br />
        <strong>B. Assessed/Estimated Billing where actual meter reading is not available</strong><br />
        For consumers, whose actual reading is not available, the assessed billing procedure is as follows:<br />
        a. Token amount (10% of the average energy consumption of past 3 months) to be billed to Industrial &amp; Commercial premises that are under lockdown.<br />
        b. In case, the amount paid by you based on the assessed billing is higher than that payable as per actual reading (when taken), the holding charge (equivalent to 1-month MCLR rate of SBI as on billing date) on the excess amount paid shall be credited to the consumer.<br />
        c. In case, the amount paid by you based on the assessed billing is lower than that payable as per actual reading (when taken), carrying cost (equivalent to 1-month MCLR rate of SBI as on billing date) shall be levied on your account. To avoid carrying cost, you can voluntarily pay any amount over &amp; above the assessed bill which would be adjusted when billing based on actual reading is undertaken post lockdown period.<br />
        <strong>C. Delayed Payment Charge (DPC)</strong>
        <br />
        1) If you have paid &ge; 80% of the bill amount, Delay Payment Charges (DPC) on the unpaid amount will be reduced to 50% E.g. if the bill amount is 2000/- &amp; if the customer has paid &gt;80% i.e. 1650 then DPC is charged as 0.65% (50% of normal charge of 1.25%) on the balance amount<br />
        So DPC would be (2000-1650) *0.65%= Rs. 2.19<br />
        2) In case the bill on actual reading (when taken) is lower than the assessed billed amount, DPC will be recomputed based on the actual bill. Any excess paid DPC will be refunded to you with a holding charge as mentioned in para B.</p></div>
