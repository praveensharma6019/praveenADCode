            <li>Due to Covid-19 precautionary directives issued by the regulator - MERC, our Customer Care Centers /Bill Payment Centers/Meter Reading/Bill Distribution / Meter testing etc which required human interface had been closed and only critical services like power supply restoration were continued with.</li>
            <li>Based on the above directives the March 20 and April 20 bills were calculated on basis of estimated consumption.</li>
            <li>This estimation was based upon average consumption of three months &ndash; Dec 19, Jan 20 and Feb 20 which pertains to the winter period</li>
            <li>Post Unlock 1.0, the meter reading process has commenced.</li>
            <li>Based on the actual meter reading we could arrive at the total consumption for March 20, April 20 and May 20. However, we are not able to ascertain the exact consumption in each of these 3 months. Hence the billing for the period has been amended and actual units have been uniformly allocated for the entire three-month period. This amount has been mentioned in your latest bill under the head &ndash; Net Previous Balance</li>
            <li>Any payment made by you during the period is also adjusted while revising the billing for the period as per your actual reading.</li>
            <li>Your May-2020 bill raised in June therefore includes the consumption of May-20 as well as differential consumption over estimation of March-20 and April-20.</li>
