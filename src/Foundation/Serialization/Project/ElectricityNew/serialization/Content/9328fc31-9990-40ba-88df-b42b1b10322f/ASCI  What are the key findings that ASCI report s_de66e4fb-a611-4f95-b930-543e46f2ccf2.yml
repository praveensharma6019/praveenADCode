        <div class="panel-body">While clearly vindicating Adani Electricity's stand, ASCI has following findings on Adani Electricity's power purchase:
        <ul>
        	<li>Process adopted for sourcing from external sources/traders is transparent.</li>
        	<li>Rate of purchase from external sources comparable favorably with the published purchase prices by Market Monitoring Cell of CERC.</li>
        	<li>Lower allocation from TPC-G (500 MW) resulted in excess drawal by Adani Electricity from imbalance pool at higher cost.</li>
        	<li>Adani Electricity-D was obligated to buy its entire requirement from TPC-G. The same was dropped from TPC's License with the issue of Specific License Conditions in August 2008. TPC was in dominance by thwarting Adani Electricity generation plans and retracted from agreed position to enter into PPA of 500 MW with post SC judgment in its favor.</li>
        </ul>
