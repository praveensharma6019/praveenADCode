        Ans: Yes. MERC MYT Regulations, 2015 speaks about the sharing methodology on account of Controllable Factors and Uncontrollable Factors.
        2/3rd of gains on account of Controllable Factors will be passed on to customers as rebate in Tariff and balance shall be retained by the Generating Company or Licensee.
        1/3rd of loss on account of Controllable Factors will be passed on to customers as additional charge in Tariff and balance shall be absorbed by the Generating Company or Licensee.
        Gains on account of Uncontrollable factors will be passed on to the customers entirely.
