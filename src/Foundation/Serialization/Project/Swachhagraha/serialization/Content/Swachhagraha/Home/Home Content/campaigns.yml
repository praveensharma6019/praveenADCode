        						<p>This campaign sought to appreciate the silent efforts of the cleaning staff in schools, houses and neighborhoods by identifying them as the ‘Stars of the Country’. It sensitizes students towards the Safai Karamcharis by developing empathy and imbibing a positive behavioural change towards maintaining cleanliness.</p>

        						<p>In this fun and interactive video making contest, students had to shoot a one-minute video asking 3-5 people around them a question “Cleanliness - Whose responsibility?” They then had to analyse and make conclusions to present their opinion as a well-informed and critical reporter.</p>
