        <p>KT Irfan has been involved with race-walking since 2006 and his professional career  started  in 2010 when after joining the Indian Army. During his childhood days in Malappuram (Kerala), Irfan used to play Cricket with his friends and would see them racing on tracks. It was only through his friends that he got to know about race-walking and developed interest towards the sport. </p>
        <p>His biggest accomplishment is breaking the Indian National record in 20 km race walking event with a finish timing of 1:20:21s at the London Olympics which also remains his fondest memory. When he returned from the Games he was surprised and overwhelmed too see people from his village gathered at the airport to receive him.  </p>
        
        <p>Irfan has qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and  is training to be at his best. His day starts at 4:00 am which includes working out in the gym, stretching exercises and running around 30 km. In addition to the morning session which lasts for 3 hours, he trains for 2 hours in the evenings</p>
