        <div class="border-box text-center">
        <p>We all celebrate when a player wins a medal for our country. We are all proud of them. But what about those sportspersons who sacrifice hours, days, months and years to achieve their dreams? Do we ever tell them we are proud of their effort, their commitment? In order to shed light on the lives of those athletes who give it their all to bring pride to the nation, we started the #GarvHai initiative - a humble effort by us to support budding athletes who strive hard to bring glory to the nation.</p>
        <p>We at Adani support them for their determination and zeal despite of the challenges they face. It&rsquo;s time for us to give these players the recognition they deserve. Through our initiative, we thank them for inspiring us, for teaching us to never give up.</p>
        <p>Through this movement, we not only celebrate their victories, but also stand up and cheer for them in order to let them know that we are by their side. We want them to know that their spirit, dreams and aspirations inspire us and we are privileged to be a part of their journey.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Now is the time for us to motivate them.<br />
        All we need from the nation is to stand by them and say #GarvHai.</h4>
        <p>The #GarvHai initiative by Adani Group undertook celebrating the commitment, sacrifice and relentless hard work practiced by Indian athletes to bring glory to the nation. In its first phase, the project involved the Adani group supporting the journey made by Shot Putter Inderjeet Singh, Boxer Shiva Thapa, Race Walker Khushbir Kaur, Boxers Mandeep Jangra and Pinki Rani, Sprinter Sanjeevani Jadhav, Shooter Malaika Goel, and Tennis player Ankita Raina.</p>
