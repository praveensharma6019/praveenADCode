        <p>From Berlin to Boston, marathons world over, became part of every global city’s social fabric. The Adani Ahmedabad Marathon that took its inaugural stride in November 2017 is warming up for its second lap, scheduled to be held on Sunday, 25 November 2018. The thumping response to Ahmedabad’s first-of- its-kind run, gave us a glimpse of the untapped desire of its citizen to have a marathon of their own. The event witnessed a gathering of over 8000 people. These included more than 1000 personnel from the defence establishment across the Air Force, Army and the Navy.</p>
