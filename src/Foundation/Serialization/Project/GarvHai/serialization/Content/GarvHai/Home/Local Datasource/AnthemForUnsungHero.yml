        <p>We all celebrate when a player wins a medal for our country. We are all proud of them. But what about those sportspersons who sacrifice hours, days, months and years to achieve their dreams? Do we ever tell them we are proud of their effort, their commitment? In order to shed light on the lives of those athletes who give it their all to bring pride to the nation, we started the #GarvHai initiative - a humble effort by us to support budding athletes who strive hard to bring glory to the nation.</p>
