        <p class="mb-3">Adani Power was the first to achieve operation of a supercritical thermal power plant in India. As technology was new, it faced major challenge in terms of availability of requisite skill and knowledge during project execution and O&M of the Supercritical Power Plants. Sensing the critical need for high level of execution and operational knowledge and skill, Adani Power quickly set-up a training and development center and launched a massive effort for intensive training of 3000 plus strong workforce. The endeavor aimed at covering all employee levels and all business functions involved in construction and O&M of thermal power plants, HVDC and EHVAC transmission line, sub-stations and distribution spread across India.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-3">The Scale and Speed of advancement could only be matched by employing modern IT and scientific tools and techniques for a Systematic Approach to Training & Developing. The scope of the programs extended to Engineering, Business Transformation and Change Management, Business Development, Techno-commercial, Finance, HRD and allied departments and services of the Adani Power Business spread across the country.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-3">APTRI has thus emerged from the intensive scientific analysis and efforts undertaken by team of highly experienced National and International senior professionals from top utilities and organization like Babcock & Wilcox, GE, ABB, Alstom, NTPC, SEBs, IPPs, other Industry clusters and Subject Matter Experts to understand and analyze the   competencies and training needs for the new technologies and operational skill across all the segments of power business throughout the entire value chain.</p>
