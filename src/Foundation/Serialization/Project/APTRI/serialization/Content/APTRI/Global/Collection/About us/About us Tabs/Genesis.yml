        <p class="mb-3">APTRI has its roots in the Adani Power vision &ldquo;&hellip;to be globally admired leader in integrated power business with deep commitment to nation building&hellip;&rsquo;&rdquo;. At Adani Power it is firmly believed that for business excellence the human resource is the most critical and valuable asset that must be nurtured by creating an engaging environment and culture of innovation and learning &amp; development. In the dynamic business environment, continual learning and development of the professionals is the only way to navigate through the prevailing VUCA - volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment. In 2006 Adani Power ventured into power business and within a short span of 8 years, commissioned a capacity of 10,440 MW and became the first to achieve operation of Supercritical thermal power plants in India thereby demonstrating the capability of a strong, competent and skilled human resources. </p>
        <p class="mb-3">In this ambitious journey, as the supercritical technology was new to the nation, Adani Power faced severe crisis of skilled and knowledgeable professionals with experience in Supercritical Technology. The team was built with members from diverse background and several proficiency levels and functional areas. The challenge therefore was in creating an engaging environment and culture of learning, unlearning &amp; re-learning .</p>
        <p class="mb-3">In response, Adani Power launched an ambitious initiative for intensive training of the then strong workforce covering all levels and all functions involved in EPC and O&amp;M of thermal power plants, HVDC and EHVAC transmission line &amp; sub-stations and distribution spread across India. APTRI was thus founded for creating an Institutional framework for creating an engaging environment and culture of learning, unlearning &amp; re-learning. </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Learning with a systematic scientific approach. The institute developed world-class infrastructure with IT enabled and Data driven program design, execution and closed-loop monitoring. The Training needs identification (TNI) of each employee was conducted and the needs analysed (TNA) for designing focused programs leading to proficiency advancement for maximum performance enhancement and employee engagement. The approach also captured inputs for developing cross-functional programs covering Business Development, Techno-commercial, and Finance, HRD and allied departments and services spread across the country. </p>
        <p class="mb-3">APTRI has thus been founded on strong role based competency model and within a short span of five years, APTRI made strong presence in utilities and organisation in domestic and international market and attracted large number of professionals. The programs are designed and delivered by highly experienced, practicing experts invited from within Adani Business.   </p>
